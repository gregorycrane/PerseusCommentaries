<head>Philippic I.</head>
<div2 type="section" n="1">
<p> Introduction (<foreign lang="greek">prooi/mion</foreign>). This subject has been so often handled by our more experienced politicians that on the present occasion I may be excused if I venture to speak first.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kainou=</lemma>, &lsquo;fresh,&rsquo; &lsquo;not previously handled,&rsquo; to be distinguished from <foreign lang="greek">ne/os</foreign>, &lsquo;young,&rsquo; &lsquo;of recent development,&rsquo; though their uses overlap to some extent.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">prou)ti/qeto</lemma>. The Prytanes, having charge of the conduct of business in the Ecclesia, are said <foreign lang="greek">protiqe/nai gnw/mas, lo/gon, yh=fon</foreign>, &lsquo;to bring forward a subject for discussion or voting.&rsquo; The imperfect implies that their action is regarded as continuing throughout the debate. Cf. Isocr. <title>de Pace</title> 15 <foreign lang="greek">parelh/luqa a)pofanou/menos...peri\ w(=n oi( pruta/neis protiqe/asin</foreign>. For the infinitive replacing the more usual accusative cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 3.38">Thuc. III.38</bibl> <foreign lang="greek">tw=n proqe/ntwn au)=qis peri\ *mutilhnai/wn le/gein</foreign>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">tw=n ei)wqo/twn</lemma>, sc. <foreign lang="greek">gnw/mhn a)pofai/nesqai</foreign>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)pefh/nanto</lemma>. The middle is regularly used with <foreign lang="greek">gnw/mhn</foreign> in this sense. The constructions following <foreign lang="greek">e(/ws</foreign> (except in clauses referring to a definite event in past time) are identical with the constructions of conditional clauses. Hence the past indicative here in dependence on a conditional sentence of an unfulfilled character.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a(\ gignw/skw</lemma>. The verb might have been attracted into the imperfect to agree with the clause on which it depends, but the present is more appropriate as suggesting that the orator's opinion is independent of the conditions mentioned.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kai\</lemma>, with the participial phrase, &lsquo;though I am the first to rise.&rsquo;</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)k tou= parelhluqo/tos</lemma>. We should say &lsquo;in time past.&rsquo; The Greek frequently shews a tendency to regard points of time in the past as starting-points and points of future time similarly as points <pb n="48"/> of arrival. So <foreign lang="greek">a)f'  e(spe/ras</foreign> (at eventide), <foreign lang="greek">a)po\ mesw=n nuktw=n</foreign> (at midnight), <foreign lang="greek">ei)s au)/rion</foreign> (to-morrow), <foreign lang="greek">ei)s tri/thn h(me/ran</foreign> (on the third day). Similarly inf. &sect; 2.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)/n</lemma>. It is a common practice to omit <foreign lang="greek">a)\n</foreign> with the imperfect indicative of verbs implying obligation and the like, just as <foreign lang="la">debebam</foreign> is used in Latin with a protasis containing an unfulfilled condition. The reason is that the obligation was, at any rate in early times, regarded as really existing independently of the condition: e.g. in <foreign lang="greek">xrh=n de\ se/, ei)/per h)=sqa xrhsto/s, mhnuth\n gene/sqai</foreign>, it really was the duty of the person addressed to give information, whether he was an honest man or not. (Such, at least, seems to be the origin of this usage.) In the present case the truth of the apodosis does manifestly depend upon that of the protasis, and in such cases <foreign lang="greek">a)\n</foreign> is fairly often inserted.
</p></div2>
<div2 type="section" n="2">
<p>&sect; 2-50  Discussion (<foreign lang="greek">a)po/deicis</foreign>) including (1) sketch of the situation (<foreign lang="greek">dih/ghsis</foreign>) &sect;&sect; 2&mdash;12, (2) proposals (<foreign lang="greek">pro/qesis</foreign>) &sect;&sect; 13&mdash;30, and (3) arguments in their support (<foreign lang="greek">pi/steis</foreign>) &sect;&sect; 31&mdash;50.</p>
<p>&sect; 2-6  Do not despair. Remember that your misfortunes have arisen from your own slackness, so that you may hope to retrieve them by diligence (2). Remember again that when Sparta was at the height of her power we were able by dint of diligence to withstand her (3). Remember also the example of Philip. He did not throw up the game because the advantages were on our side; and now through his diligence they are all on his (4&mdash;6).</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">o(\ ga/r e)sti xei/riston</lemma>. The paradox, repeated in <title>Phil.</title> 3. 5, serves to excite the hearers' curiosity from the outset.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">poiou/ntwn u(mw=n</lemma>. The genitive absolute, as frequently, contains an idea more important than that of the main clause to which it is attached: &lsquo;the fact that the evil plight of your affairs is due to your neglect of all proper measures.&rsquo;</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">pratto/ntwn</lemma>. The subject of a participle used absolutely in the genitive is sometimes omitted when (1) it can be supplied easily from the context, or (2) it is indefinite.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">gene/sqai</lemma> refers of course to time which, in relation to <foreign lang="greek">e)lpi\s h)=n</foreign>, is future. But after verbs and verbal phrases expressing hope the aorist infinitive is sometimes so employed. Cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 4.24">Thuc. IV.24</bibl> <foreign lang="greek">to\ *(rh/gion h)/lpizon r(a|di/ws xeirw/sasqai</foreign>. Indeed the aorist, except in the indicative and in the infinitive and participle where these in some sense represent indicatives, carries no significance of time. <foreign lang="greek">a)\n</foreign> must of course be taken with <foreign lang="greek">h)=n</foreign>. <pb n="49"/>
</p></div2>
<div2 type="section" n="3">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)kou/ousi</lemma> and <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)namimnh|skome/nois</lemma> are syntactically parallel: the former participle seems at first to agree with <foreign lang="greek">u(mi=n</foreign> understood, but the subdivision of <foreign lang="greek">u(mi=n</foreign> which appears in the second member with <foreign lang="greek">toi=s ei)do/sin au)toi=s</foreign> makes it clear that <foreign lang="greek">a)kou/ousi</foreign> is intended to apply only to <foreign lang="greek">toi=s mh\ au)toi=s ei)do/sin u(mw=n</foreign>. Cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.42">Thuc. I.42</bibl> <foreign lang="greek">w(=n e)nqumhqe/ntes kai\ new/tero/s tis para\ presbute/rwn au)ta\ maqw/n</foreign>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">au)toi=s</lemma>, almost &lsquo;by personal experience,&rsquo; with <foreign lang="greek">ei)do/sin</foreign>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">h(li/khn ... w(s kalw=s</lemma> . The double question, whether direct or reported, is a regular Greek idiom. Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Rep. 332D">Plato, Rep. 332 D</bibl> <foreign lang="greek">h( ti/si ti/ a)podidou=sa te/xnh</foreign>;  <cit><bibl n="Soph. El. 751">Soph. <title>El.</title> 751</bibl> <quote lang="greek">oi(=' e)/rga dra/sas oi(=a lagxa/nei kaka/</quote></cit>. In instances like the present there is some doubt whether forms like <foreign lang="greek">h(li/kos</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">oi(=os</foreign> are to be regarded (1) as used loosely for the dependent interrogative forms (<foreign lang="greek">o(phli/kos, o(poi=os</foreign>, &amp;c.), (2) as dependent exclamations, or (3) as strictly relative.</p>
<p>The vagueness of <foreign lang="greek">e)c ou(= xro/nos ou) polu\s</foreign> allows us to suppose that the speaker alludes to the &lsquo;Corinthian&rsquo; war which began in 395 B.C. or the &lsquo;Boeotian&rsquo; which began in 378.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">qea/shsqe</lemma> is not by any means a mere synonym of <foreign lang="greek">i)dh=te</foreign>: Demosthenes wishes his hearers not merely to perceive the fact, but also to contemplate it.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">fulattome/nois</lemma>. Participle used conditionally, parallel to <foreign lang="greek">a)\n o)ligwrh=te</foreign>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">mhde\n</lemma> is to be taken adverbially, the regular construction after <foreign lang="greek">fronti/zein</foreign> being a genitive. Why not <foreign lang="greek">ou)de/n</foreign>?
</p></div2>
<div2 type="section" n="4">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ta\ xwri/a</lemma>, especially those mentioned just below.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">to\n to/pon tou=ton</lemma>, the shores of the Thermaic gulf. Notice that <foreign lang="greek">oi)kei=on</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ku/klw|</foreign> are predicative and belong to <foreign lang="greek">ei)/xomen</foreign>: the position of <foreign lang="greek">ku/klw|</foreign> in separation from the article prevents us from taking it as attributive, though it may be translated as if it were so (Liddell and Scott's view is untenable). See Introd., &sect;&sect; 5, 6.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)qnw=n</lemma>, especially the Illyrians and Paeonians.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)leu/qera</lemma> is stronger than <foreign lang="greek">au)tonomou/mena</foreign>, denoting complete independence of any foreign power: the words are often coupled.
</p></div2>
<div2 type="section" n="5">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">th=s au(tou= xw/ras</lemma>, objective genitive, as representing the dative after <foreign lang="greek">e)piteixi/zein</foreign>: &lsquo;fortified bases for operations against his territory.&rsquo; Note the direct reflexive form referring to the subject, not of the nearest verb (<foreign lang="greek">e)/xousi</foreign>) but of the more remote: the indirect form (<foreign lang="greek">ou(=</foreign>) is not much used in Attic prose and its place is taken either by the direct, as here, or by the simple personal pronoun (<foreign lang="greek">au)tou=</foreign>) according to the amount of emphasis required. <pb n="50"/></p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)/pracen</lemma>, almost synonymous with <foreign lang="greek">e)poi/hsen</foreign>, as in sup. &sect; 2, and often. So far as they differ in meaning, <foreign lang="greek">poiei=n</foreign> implies complete accomplishment of an act, while <foreign lang="greek">pra/ttein</foreign> does not.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)n me/sw|</lemma>, as the prizes for athletic competitions were exposed in the arena.
</p></div2>
<div2 type="section" n="6">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kai\ ga/r toi</lemma>, stronger than <foreign lang="greek">kai\ ga/r</foreign>: in this connexion <foreign lang="greek">kai\</foreign> means &lsquo;also&rsquo; (i.e. &lsquo;in addition to other reasons&rsquo;).</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">poihsa/menos</lemma>. The participle is used in a modal sense, so that it is parallel in sense to the modal clause <foreign lang="greek">w(s a)\n...pole/mw|</foreign>, and is therefore treated as parallel in syntax.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kai\ prose/xein k.t.e(.</lemma>, a hexameter verse, such as is very rarely found in Demosthenes.
</p></div2>
<div2 type="section" n="7">
<p>&sect; 7-12  Profit by these lessons and you may still retrieve your losses and punish Philip (7). For his supporters would not all be sorry to see his fall. Only you must rouse yourselves at once (8). Consider his presumptuous and aggressive attitude (9). Is not mere shame enough to rouse you to immediate action? At present you listen eagerly enough to reports unfavourable to his success, but in action you are so slack that even if Philip were dead your attitude would make his successor equally formidable (10, 11). Indeed, unless you shew more vigour, even that favourable opportunity would not enable you to recover one of your lost cities (12).</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)pi\ th=s toiau/ths gnw/mhs</lemma>, rather a remarkable use: we may suppose that <foreign lang="greek">e)pi\</foreign> with the genitive developed meanings in the following order&mdash;(1) on or over, (2) in charge of (frequently in the titles of officials, as <foreign lang="greek">o( e)pi\ th=s dioikh/sews</foreign>), (3) in possession of. The last meaning appears inf. 9 and, with a slight modification, in the present passage. Cf. Dem. 21. 213 <foreign lang="greek">th\n gnw/mhn tau/thn, e)f'  h(=s nu=n e)ste/</foreign>. Render &lsquo;to adopt a view like this.&rsquo;</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">nu=n</lemma> is sharply emphasised by its position at the end of the clause &mdash;&lsquo;even now, late as it is.&rsquo; Supply <foreign lang="greek">e)ge/nesqe</foreign> with <foreign lang="greek">ou) pro/teron</foreign>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">th\n ei)rwnei/an</lemma>, &lsquo;your false modesty,&rsquo; the article implies that it does exist. The <foreign lang="greek">ei)/rwn</foreign> is a man who pretends to have defects which he has not; so Socrates was said <foreign lang="greek">ei)rwneu/esqai</foreign> because in discussion he affected complete ignorance.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ei)sfe/rein</lemma>, to bear his share of an <foreign lang="greek">ei)sfora/</foreign>, a property-tax specially levied to meet particular emergencies, especially for the expenses of war.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)n h(liki/a|</lemma>. Athenian citizens were liable to military service between the ages of 18 and 60; but unless under exceptional <pb n="51"/> circumstances only those between 20 and 50 were called out for foreign service, and commonly only in part.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">sunelo/nti</lemma>, apparently a dative due to ellipse. Cf. Isaeus 4. 22 <foreign lang="greek">sunelo/nti polu\ to\ dia/feron</foreign>.</p>
<p>In Xenophon we have a fuller phrase <foreign lang="greek">w(s sunelo/nti ei)pei=n</foreign> (e.g. <bibl n="Xen. Anab. 3.1.38"><title>An.</title> 3. 1. 38</bibl>) in which it is easy to supply <foreign lang="greek">e)sti/</foreign>&mdash;&lsquo;as one summing up the matter may say.&rsquo; <foreign lang="greek">aplw=s</foreign>, if retained, is to be taken with <foreign lang="greek">gene/sqai u(mw=n au)tw=n</foreign>; some commentators would omit it.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">u(mw=n au)tw=n</lemma>, &lsquo;your own men&rsquo;: we should look at the matter from the other side and say &lsquo;your own masters.&rsquo;</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">au)to\s me\n k.t.e(.</lemma> Take <foreign lang="greek">au)to\s</foreign> with <foreign lang="greek">poih/sein</foreign>, &lsquo;imagining that he himself will do nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">u(pe\r au)tou=</lemma>. Some read <foreign lang="greek">au(tou=</foreign> here, but there is no emphasis to justify it. See on sup. 5.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">qe/lh|</lemma>. The regular form of the verb in Attic prose is <foreign lang="greek">e)qe/lein</foreign>, but <foreign lang="greek">qe/lein</foreign> is found in certain set phrases, such as the present.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">katerra|qumhme/na</lemma>, &lsquo;lost by shirking&rsquo;: for the force of <foreign lang="greek">kata\</foreign> cf. <foreign lang="greek">katakubeu/ein</foreign> &lsquo;to gamble away,&rsquo; <foreign lang="greek">katafronti/zein</foreign> &lsquo;to lose by taking thought.&rsquo;
</p></div2>
<div2 type="section" n="8">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)qa/nata</lemma>, predicatively with <foreign lang="greek">pephge/nai</foreign>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">misei= tis</lemma>. The singular <foreign lang="greek">tis</foreign> is here used in a sort of collective sense, &lsquo;many a one.&rsquo; Similarly <bibl n="Thuc. 3.111">Thuc. III.111</bibl> <foreign lang="greek">kai/ tinas au)tw=n tw=n strathgw=n h)ko/ntise tis</foreign>. Not infrequently <foreign lang="greek">tis</foreign> is used with active verbs, like <foreign lang="fr">on</foreign> in French, in substitution for a passive construction.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">pa/nu</lemma>, with <foreign lang="greek">oi)kei/ws</foreign> rather than with <foreign lang="greek">dokou/ntwn</foreign>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a(/panta</lemma>, &lsquo;all the characteristics,&rsquo; &lsquo;feelings&rsquo; or &lsquo;impulses.&rsquo;</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)postrofh/n</lemma> <foreign lang="greek">, o(/poi a)postrafw=si</foreign>, &lsquo;rallying-centre&rsquo;&mdash;apparently a metaphor from tactics. The alternative rendering &lsquo;refuge&rsquo; does not suit the general sense so well. Cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 4.76">Thuc. IV.76</bibl> <foreign lang="greek">ou)/shs e(ka/stois dia\ braxe/os a)postrofh=s</foreign>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">h)/dh</lemma>, placed at the end for emphasis.
</p></div2>
<div2 type="section" n="9">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">o(ra=te</lemma>, indicative or imperative?</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">oi(=</lemma>, with <foreign lang="greek">a)selgei/as</foreign>, &lsquo;to what lengths of outrage.&rsquo; Cf.  <cit><bibl n="Soph. El. 1035">Soph. <title>El.</title> 1035</bibl> <quote lang="greek">oi(= m' a)timi/as a)/geis</quote></cit>. So <foreign lang="greek">e)ntau=q'  a)fiko/mhn kakou=</foreign>, Aesch. <title>Cho.</title> 691, but the demonstrative form is generally <foreign lang="greek">ei)s tou=to</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">tosou=to</foreign>: cf. Dem. 18. 22 <foreign lang="greek">ei)s tou=q'  h(=ken a)naidei/as</foreign>. The clause introduced by <foreign lang="greek">oi(=</foreign> is epexegetic of <foreign lang="greek">to\ pra=gma</foreign>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">o(/s</lemma>, <foreign lang="la">quippe qui</foreign>, introducing a clause of causal character.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ou)x oi(=o/s e)sti</lemma>, &lsquo;is not the man to&rsquo;: the use of the infinitive after a relative is curious, though it is common in the case of <foreign lang="greek">oi(=os</foreign> and <pb n="52"/> <foreign lang="greek">o(/sos</foreign>; it may perhaps have had its origin in the construction of <foreign lang="greek">toiou=tos</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">tosou=tos</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">w(/ste</foreign>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">prosperiba/lletai</lemma>, &lsquo;is striving further to acquire.&rsquo; The metaphor was either from putting on a robe or from surrounding a quarry in the chase (cf. Dem. 304. 25 <foreign lang="greek">ta\ loipa\ periballo/menos</foreign>): the latter view is supported by <foreign lang="greek">peristoixi/zetai</foreign>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kaqhme/nous</lemma>, &lsquo;sitting idle&rsquo;; cf. Dem. 25. 10 <foreign lang="greek">ta\ d'  u(me/ter' au)tw=n a)polwleko/tes kaqh=sqe</foreign>.
</p></div2>
<div2 type="section" n="10">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)peida\n ti/ ge/nhtai</lemma>; Greek freely employs interrogatives in subordinate clauses and with participles. So <foreign lang="greek">i(/na ti/;</foreign> (sc. <foreign lang="greek">ge/nhtai</foreign>) &lsquo;with what object?&rsquo; <foreign lang="greek">ti/ maqw/n;</foreign> &lsquo;on the ground of what knowledge?&rsquo;</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">nh\ *di/a</lemma>, frequently used, as here, in phrases put in the mouth of an imaginary interlocutor.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)na/gkh</lemma>, sc. <foreign lang="greek">ge/nhtai</foreign>. The best MS. authority favours <foreign lang="greek">a)na/gkh h)=|</foreign>, but the hiatus seems too harsh for Demosthenes, and we are left to choose between omitting <foreign lang="greek">h)=|</foreign> (which may have arisen (1) from accidental duplication of the last letter of <foreign lang="greek">a)na/gkh</foreign> or (2) from deliberate insertion by a copyist who desiderated a complete construction) and reading <foreign lang="greek">a)na/gkh tis h)=|</foreign> with inferior MSS.</p>

The thought is repeated in much the same form in 8. 51.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ei)pe/ moi</lemma>, a &lsquo;petrified&rsquo; phrase, used not infrequently in addressing a plurality of persons: cf. Dem. 8. 74.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">au(tw=n</lemma>, for <foreign lang="greek">a)llh/lwn</foreign>, as fairly often; cf. <title>Phil.</title> 3. 21 <foreign lang="greek">a)pi/stws kai\ stasiastikw=s e)/xousi pro\s au(tou\s oi( *(/ellhnes</foreign>. For its use in reference to the second person, cf. Aeschines 3. 163 <foreign lang="greek">bou/lei se qw= fobhqh=nai kai\ xrh/sasqai tw=| au(tou= tro/pw|</foreign>.</p>
<p>The orator is girding at the well-known curiosity of his countrymen, mentioned frequently in their literature, and in Acts 17. 21.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ge/noit'  a)/n</lemma>. The question is pointed by the abruptness of asyndeton.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">dioikw=n</lemma>, referring especially to Philip's intervention in the Sacred War.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">be/ltion</lemma>, sc. <foreign lang="greek">h(mw=n e)pimelei=tai</foreign>. When a verb serves as predicate to more than one subject, it frequently agrees with the nearest subject only. This occurs sometimes even when the subjects are, as here, not co-ordinate; cf.

For the thought, cf. <bibl n="Aristoph.

<p>Polystratus is only otherwise known as having received a public honour on the request of Iphicrates (Dem. 20. 84).</p>
<p>Iphicrates was one of the most distinguished of Athenian generals and a man of original talent. He dealt the first blow to the traditional supremacy of heavy-armed troops by organising a force of mercenaries with an equipment intermediate between that of hoplites and that of peltasts; and with his light troops in 390 B.C. he cut to pieces a Lacedaemonian <foreign lang="greek">mo/ra</foreign> (600 hoplites), an exploit loudly applauded by his countrymen.</p>
<p>Chabrias superseded Iphicrates as Athenian general in the Corinthian war, but was more famous for his defeat of the Lacedaemonian fleet at Naxos in 376. He was killed in the siege of Chios (357 B.C.).</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)kou/wn</lemma>, &lsquo;by hearsay&rsquo;; the sense does not allow us to regard the participle as taking the place of an object-clause.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)ni/kwn</lemma> may refer only to the defeat of the <foreign lang="greek">mo/ra</foreign>, as the imperfect of <foreign lang="greek">nika=n</foreign> is often used of a single battle where we might have expected the aorist.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">u(mi=n</lemma>. The dative (of persons) is frequently used where a possessive genitive would stand and give almost the same sense. The difference is that the dative brings the person into relation with the verb instead of with the substantive&mdash;&lsquo;you have your mercenaries serving.&rsquo;</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">tou\s fi/lous</lemma>. Isocrates, speaking in 356 B.C. (8. 46), makes the same complaint. Such bodies of mercenaries used to plunder friendly territory as readily as hostile. <pb n="61"/></p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)xqroi\</lemma> makes the hostility of Macedon a more fundamental matter than <foreign lang="greek">pole/mioi</foreign>, which simply implies the existence of war at the moment.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">paraku/yanta</lemma>, &lsquo;after a mere glance.&rsquo; The word is almost confined to comedy (especially of peeping through a window), and suits the satirical character of the passage.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">pro\s *)arta/bazon</lemma>, referring to Chares, who, when despatched by Athens against the rebellious allies in 356 B.C., enrolled himself and his mercenaries under A., then in rebellion against Artaxerxes, in order to secure pay, which Athens did not provide with regularity. It was perhaps the importance of Chares to Athens which led Demosthenes to throw the blame more on the men than on their commander in this passage.</p>

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)xeirotonei=te</lemma>. The tense is curious; either it &lsquo;implies a retrospect over the whole duration of the war&rsquo; (Sandys) or the imperfect of &lsquo;narrative giving place to description,&rsquo; as Rutherford <pb n="62"/> expresses it.

Neither seems to me satisfactory, and I suspect that Demosthenes really used the present.</p>
<p>Military officers at Athens, unlike most officials, were appointed by election, not by lot.</p>
<p>There was one <foreign lang="greek">taci/arxos</foreign> (infantry) and one <foreign lang="greek">fu/larxos</foreign> (cavalry) for each tribe. The supervision of the <foreign lang="greek">strathgoi\</foreign> and (for cavalry) the <foreign lang="greek">i(/pparxoi</foreign> was in earlier times exercised jointly, but recently separate provinces had been assigned to the several <foreign lang="greek">strathgoi/</foreign>, so that here we find one only in charge of the war.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">pe/mpousi</lemma>, &lsquo;marshal&rsquo;; the play on words between this and <foreign lang="greek">e)kpe/myhte</foreign> is obvious enough.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">i(eropoiw=n</lemma>, a board appointed by lot to supervise the quadrennial festivals (except the Panathenaea); see Aristotle, <foreign lang="greek">*)aq. *pol</foreign>. 54. 6.</p>
<p>The <foreign lang="greek">i(/pparxoi</foreign> were in charge of the cavalry who took part in the Panathenaic procession, as shewn on the frieze of the Parthenon. Probably the hoplites who also marched in that procession were similarly under the direction of their own officers. A ceremonial inscription of 340 B.C. associates the generals and taxiarchs with the <foreign lang="greek">i(eropoioi/</foreign>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">tou\s phli/nous</lemma>, sc. <foreign lang="greek">a)nqrw/pous</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">a)ndri/antas</foreign> or, less probably, <foreign lang="greek">tacia/rxous kai\ fula/rxous</foreign>; referring to the terra-cotta figurines of which so many have been discovered in recent years.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ei)s th\n a)gora/n</lemma>, i.e. in the case of the figures, for sale, in the case of the officers, for mere display on ceremonial occasions, the <foreign lang="greek">a)gora\</foreign> being the principal scene of these pageants.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">i(/pparxon</lemma>, singular, in the view of most authorities, because one of the two <foreign lang="greek">i(/pparxoi</foreign> necessarily remained at Athens to take part in ceremonies. But (1) it is not clear that this was the case; on the contrary it is probable <hi rend="italic">&agrave; priori</hi> that in the case of important campaigns both hipparchs would serve abroad, each commanding his five tribes; (2) even if that was the case, the singular is not necessary, as the plural might quite naturally be used of successive officers, and (3) all MSS. except S give the plural. (Voemel's contention that the plural would require the article is untenable.)</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)/rxontas</lemma> resumes <foreign lang="greek">tacia/rxous</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">i(ppa/rxous</foreign> under a more general term, <foreign lang="greek">oi)kei/ous</foreign> (used predicatively) being parallel to and practically <pb n="63"/> synonymous with <foreign lang="greek">par'  u(mw=n</foreign>.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">i(/n'  h)=n</lemma>. In final clauses introduced by <foreign lang="greek">i(/na, o(/pws</foreign>, or <foreign lang="greek">w(s</foreign> a past tense of the indicative is regularly used when the main clause contains a past indicative expressing what is not the case (an unfulfilled wish, the protasis or the apodosis of a conditional sentence): sometimes also when the main verb is not a past indicative but the significance is of a similar character (e.g. <cit><bibl n="Eur. Hec. 814">Eur. <title>Hec.</title> 814</bibl> <quote lang="greek">ti/...peiqw\... ou)de\n...spouda/zomen...manqa/nein, i(/n'  h)=n pote pei/qein a(/ tis bou/loito</quote></cit>, where <foreign lang="greek">ti/ ou)de\n spouda/zomen</foreign> is nearly equivalent in meaning to <foreign lang="greek">e)xrh=n spouda/zein</foreign>).</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">w(s a)lhqw=s</lemma>: so <foreign lang="greek">w(s e(te/rws, w(sau/tws</foreign>; so far as meaning goes, the <foreign lang="greek">w(s</foreign> may be ignored. Three explanations of the origin of this idiom have been suggested: (1) <foreign lang="greek">w(s</foreign> is exclamatory; (2) <foreign lang="greek">w(s</foreign> is relative with an ellipse <foreign lang="greek">w(s a)\n a)lhqw=s e)/xoi</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ei)/poi tis</foreign>; (3) <foreign lang="greek">w(s</foreign> is a survival of a declension of the article without <foreign lang="greek">t</foreign>, agreeing with <foreign lang="greek">a)lhqw=s</foreign>, it being probable that adverbs in <foreign lang="greek">-w=s</foreign> were originally <emph>cases</emph> of adjectives. The last explanation is probably the best.</p>
<p>The suggestion clearly implied here, though Demosthenes refrains from making a definite proposal, is that all the superior officers of forces employed by Athens should be appointed by the state. We infer that at present the <foreign lang="greek">strathgo\s</foreign> in charge of operations organised his command according to his own pleasure.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ei)s *lh=mnon</lemma>. This hipparch is distinct from the two regular officers mentioned above. He was a comparatively unimportant officer who commanded a cavalry corps stationed in that island (Aristotle, <foreign lang="greek">*)aq. *pol</foreign>. 61. 6).</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*mene/laon</lemma>, reasonably identified with a certain Pelagonian from Upper Macedonia, who assisted Timotheus in his campaigns.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">i(pparxei=n</lemma>, not in its special sense, but simply &lsquo;to be in command of the cavalry.&rsquo;</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">to\n a)/ndra</lemma>. The accusative and the dative seem to be used indifferently after <foreign lang="greek">me/mfomai</foreign> of the person blamed.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">o(/stis a)\n h)=|</lemma>, after <foreign lang="greek">e)/dei</foreign>, where one might expect <foreign lang="greek">o(/stis ei)/h</foreign>. The form appropriate to primary sequence is preferred because the significance of the sentence is that of a general statement in <hi rend="italic">present</hi> time.

<p>It is unfortunate that the financial proposals have not been preserved. Dionysius of Halicarnassus makes the speech end here and treats the following sections as a separate speech.

Also he provides no antecedent for <foreign lang="greek">tau=ta</foreign> in the next sentence, leaving it meaningless.

An ellipse arose in this way, and this ellipse not being distinctly realised the relative <foreign lang="greek">w(/sper</foreign> might be provided with a construction giving the same sense, but not corresponding exactly to the main clause, e.g. <foreign lang="greek">kakw=s pa/sxw ou)x w(/sper to\ pro/teron hu)daimo/noun</foreign>. This practice would then be extended, until, as we find often in classical Attic, <foreign lang="greek">ou)x w(/sper</foreign> could be used almost anywhere with a force which may be rendered by &lsquo;whereas on the contrary.&rsquo; If we must supply a construction (which Demosthenes would not have been conscious of omitting) it would run somewhat like this&mdash; <foreign lang="greek">ou)k</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">e)n tw=| kakw=s pa/sxein</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">w(/sper</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">h)=te</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">to\n parelqo/nta xro/non</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">o(/te</foreign>).

<div2 type="section" n="1">
<p>&sect; 1-5  Introduction (<foreign lang="greek">prooi/mion</foreign>). When we discuss Philip's violations of the peace, our verbal protests are quite justifiable, but they bring no practical results (1). The difficulty is that the more evidence we have of his wrongdoing, the harder it becomes to suggest a policy (2): because, whereas action is necessary, our politicians, through fear of unpopularity, shrink from advising active measures and take refuge in denunciations, while you, for all the correctness of your attitude towards right and wrong, are not ready to check the latter by active exertion (3). Naturally therefore your success is verbal, Philip's practical. You can prove your pleas against him easily enough (4). But if we are to retrieve our losses we must change our course and prefer a salutary to a popular policy (5).</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">pra/ttei kai\ bia/zetai</lemma>. The two verbs are best taken as alternative descriptions of the same course of action (such as are frequently coupled by <foreign lang="greek">kai\</foreign>)&mdash;&lsquo;is doing, yes, violently doing.&rsquo; Render &lsquo;about Philip's lawlessly aggressive policy.&rsquo; Other solutions are (1) to supply <foreign lang="greek">pra/ttein</foreign> with <foreign lang="greek">bia/zetai</foreign>, &lsquo;forcibly endeavours to effect,&rsquo; and (2) to suppose the two verbs to be contrasted, &lsquo;Philip's policy whether of intrigue or of violence.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&sect; 7-12  After the peace Philip's first act was to make himself master of Thermopylae and Phocis. These advantages he employed for the benefit of Thebes, not of Athens, because he was pursuing his own ends (7) and knew that Athens would never basely betray the interests of Greece to him (8), whereas Thebes would readily aid him to secure her own profit. With the same policy he is now favouring Argos and the Messenians. This is a compliment to you (9); for it shews that Philip does not believe that any consideration would bribe you to surrender the welfare of Greece. His belief in your honour and in the baseness of Argos and Thebes is justified by history (10). <pb n="80"/> In the Persian Wars you refused to treat with the invaders, and earned great glory by the heroism of your resistance, while Thebes joined the Persians and Argos offered no opposition (11).

<p>&sect; 17-19  Philip is really forced to side with our enemies. For (a) his great object is empire, and you are therefore his obvious <pb n="85"/> rivals, and (b) he has already had to incur your enmity in the pursuit of his aim (17). Knowing that you are aware of his designs and must therefore detest him, he is eager to strike before you can strike him (18). Hence his restless activity and his friendly attitude towards such Greeks as he considers will seek their own advantage and fail to foresee his ultimate purposes. Yet these purposes are easy to guess. let me repeat to you the warmng which I gave to the Messenians and Argives (19).</p>

There is some ambiguity here: <foreign lang="greek">proei=to</foreign> may be either optative or indicative of the aorist or pluperfect indicative. There is no ground for taking the last view, but each of the others is fairly reasonable.

For the same reason I accept Cobet's <foreign lang="greek">h(gei=tai</foreign> for the MS. reading <foreign lang="greek">h(gei=to</foreign> (S) or <foreign lang="greek">h(goi=to</foreign>.

<p>&sect; 1-5  Introduction (<foreign lang="greek">prooi/mion</foreign>). We are always discussing the wrongs we endure from Philip, but yet things are so bad that they could not be worse (1). Of many reasons for this the chief is the action of those who aim at popularity rather than patriotism. They occupy your attention so fully that Philip can do what he likes unmolested (2). I must ask you to listen calmly if I speak with freedom: freedom of speech is strangely excluded from our debates (3). The result is that while you listen with delight to complaisant rhetoric, you are involved in extreme perils. If you are now willing to listen without prejudice, I will speak: it is yet possible to retrieve our losses (4). The worst factor in past events affords most hope for the future&mdash;I mean the fact that it is by complete neglect of your duties that you have come into this plight. Otherwise there were no hope; but as things are it is only Athenian negligence, not Athens herself, that Philip has defeated (5).</p>

Why did Athens take so strong a step in a case so little connected with her (43)? Common outlawry would have been no great hardship. But the special nature of this outlawry appears from the homicide laws; it meant that he might be put to death with impunity (44).

Now treachery is prevalent, pitched battles are rare and Philip's successes are largely due to his cavalry and light troops (49), and to his siege-engines: he fights, too, all the year round (50). We must then neglect antiquated precedents, seek to nip his projects in the bud and avoid a decisive struggle (51).

In Oreus there was a Macedonian party, opposed by Euphraeus (59): he became unpopular, and when he attempted to overthrow his opponents he was arrested as a disturber (60).

<p>&sect; 63-67  In these cases, as at Athens, the Macedonian party's popularity is due to the fact that a patriot is bound to propose salutary measures, while Philip's supporters can gain their ends by urging comfortable counsels (63).

This, I fear, may happen at Athens. I hope the choice may not be forced upon us; but if it is, death is better than truckling to Philip. Remember the recompense for their complaisance which has fallen to Oreus (65) and Eretria and Olynthus (66).

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*lasqe/nhn</lemma>. According to a fragment of Hyperides, Euthycrates was <foreign lang="greek">i(/pparxos</foreign> and betrayed the cavalry to Philip (cf. sup. &sect; 56): Lasthenes may have been associated with him.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ta\ toiau=ta</lemma>. The instances given have been instances in which Greek peoples hoped to avoid destruction <foreign lang="greek">kolakei/a| *fili/ppou</foreign>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">mhde\n</lemma> (Seager) does not occur in the MSS., but it seems fairly clear that <foreign lang="greek">ou) deino\n pei/somai</foreign> is not Attic Greek for <foreign lang="greek">ou)de\n deino\n pei/somai</foreign>. The negative would normally be <foreign lang="greek">ou)</foreign>, since the infinitive <pb n="119"/> is due merely to the oblique form of the sentence, as its tense indicates: but <foreign lang="greek">mh\</foreign> is sometimes used after <foreign lang="greek">w(/ste</foreign> in such cases.

<p>&sect; 68-72  Imagine your shame hereafter when you realise what you ought to have done. The Olynthians and the rest can now see the course they should have taken (68), but it is too late. If the ship is to be saved, every man in his place must do his duty while she is yet uninjured: efforts are futile when she is sinking (69). So with Athens. My proposals are ready. We must make complete preparations for war (Athens at least must do her duty) (70), and then seek to combine the rest of Greece in our support. At least we can delay our fate (71), and as our foe is but mortal, delay has its value, as had our efforts last year which checked Philip in Ambracia and in the Peloponnese (72).</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)\n</lemma> with <foreign lang="greek">gene/sqai</foreign>, though we render &lsquo;who <emph>would have</emph> thought?&rsquo; It is possible, though hardly likely, that in such cases the <foreign lang="greek">a)\n</foreign> did double duty and modified the governing verb also: the aorist infinitive cannot dispense with the <foreign lang="greek">a)\n</foreign> without changing its meaning.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">to\ kai\ to/</lemma>, a special phrase in which the article retains its old pronominal value&mdash;&lsquo;such and such a thing.&rsquo; We cannot be sure whether, when the same idea was to be repeated, a single <foreign lang="greek">to\</foreign> was sufficient in the second case, or whether we should here read <foreign lang="greek">kai\ to\ kai\ to\ mh\ poih=sai</foreign>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">polla/</lemma>. This passage is strongly marked with fervour, notable in the repetition of this word and the asyndetic construction of &sect;&sect; 65&mdash;69.
</p></div2>
<div2 type="section" n="69">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">sw/|zhtai</lemma>, &lsquo;continues undamaged.&rsquo;</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">u(pe/rsxh|</lemma>, literal, &lsquo;has overflowed it,&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;has got the upper hand.&rsquo; For the metaphor of the ship cf. Dem. 19. 250.
</p></div2>
<div2 type="section" n="70">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ti/ poiw=men</lemma>; The orator breaks off his own sentence, with a question from an imaginary interrupter; the answer to this question provides also the completion of the interrupted construction; but that answer is itself interrupted by two parentheses (<foreign lang="greek">trih/resi...le/gw</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">kai\ ga\r a)\n...a)gwniste/on</foreign>) and followed by a final clause to which another parenthesis (<foreign lang="greek">ou)de\ ga\r...katastre/yasqai</foreign>)&mdash;see however Introd. &sect; 23&mdash;is prefixed.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">h(de/ws a)\n ... e)rwth/sas</lemma> , equivalent to <foreign lang="greek">o(/stis h(de/ws a)\n e)rwth/seie</foreign>. All the MSS. give <foreign lang="greek">e)rwth/swn</foreign>, but it seems fairly certain that all the examples in which any part of the future is found in prose with <foreign lang="greek">a)\n</foreign> are due to corruption. See however Goodwin, <title>M. and T.</title>, 197, 208, 216. <pb n="120"/></p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kai\ gra/yw de/</lemma>, &lsquo;and will also make a (formal) proposal.&rsquo; <foreign lang="greek">de\</foreign> is the conjunction (postponed when the sentence begins with <foreign lang="greek">kai\</foreign>) and <foreign lang="greek">kai\</foreign>=&lsquo;also.&rsquo; So Dem. 18. 215 <foreign lang="greek">kai\ para\ pa=si de/</foreign>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">au)toi\</lemma> emphasises the antithesis between the direct action of Athens and her invitation to others to act.
</p></div2>
<div2 type="section" n="71">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">pareskeuasme/noi</lemma>. Note the change of tense: in resuming the clause the orator has conceived a somewhat different manner of completing it. The perfect suggests that the state of readiness is to be <emph>maintained</emph>: the aorist <foreign lang="greek">poih/santes</foreign>, which is equally appropriate, merely indicates the sequence of actions.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">tou\s tau=ta dida/contas</lemma>, &lsquo;to explain our policy&rsquo;: for the form see on <title>Phil.</title> 1. 23.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)fe/sthke</lemma>, &lsquo;it is foreign to.&rsquo;</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ei) de\ mh\</lemma> has so far become a stereotyped phrase that it is preferred to <foreign lang="greek">e)a\n de\ mh/</foreign>, though it follows <foreign lang="greek">e)a\n me/n</foreign>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">xro/nous</lemma>, &lsquo;delay&rsquo; as in Dem. 23. 93. The idea is that the Greek states may be induced at least to pause before siding with Philip, or Philip may think it wise to pause until these negotiations are ended.
</p></div2>
<div2 type="section" n="72">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)/ndra</lemma>, still more explicitly put in Dem. 19. 55 <foreign lang="greek">a)/ndra qnhto/n</foreign>. If Athens could maintain her position till Philip's death, all would be well. Demosthenes could not foresee that his successor would be even more formidable.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">peri\ th\n *pelopo/nnhson</lemma>, without the article, because the phrase is treated as forming a single attribute in conjunction with <foreign lang="greek">pe/rusin</foreign> (343 B.C.).</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a\s ... perih/lqomen</lemma>. The relative clause is formed to suit only the earlier of its two antecedents, as <foreign lang="greek">perielqei=n presbei/an</foreign> (internal accusative) is Greek but <foreign lang="greek">perielqei=n kathgori/an</foreign> is not. The reason seems to be that <foreign lang="greek">presbei=ai</foreign> is in thought the more important, <foreign lang="greek">presbei=ai kai\ kathgori/ai</foreign> being almost equivalent to <foreign lang="greek">presbei=ai kathgori/as fe/rousai</foreign> (a sort of <foreign lang="greek">e(\n dia\ duoi=n</foreign>). The following clause, <foreign lang="greek">kai\ e)poih/samen k.t.e(.</foreign>, is grammatically, though not logically, independent of the relative. See on <title>Phil.</title> 1. 35.</p>
<p>Polyeuctus and Hegesippus were prominent members of the antiMacedonian party.

<div2 type="section" n="73">
<p>&sect; 73-75  But do not call in the rest without acting yourselves. It is foolish to pretend interest in others' welfare while you neglect your own urgent needs. No: support your troops, make your preparations, and then strive to rouse the rest of Greece, as your prestige requires (73). No other city can save Greece while Athens hangs <pb n="121"/> back: it is you who must take the lead (74). If each of us sits idle waiting for others to do the work, he will never find these others, and we shall at last be obliged to tackle all the irksome tasks at once (75).</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">au(tw=n</lemma>, here either of the first or second person; cf. <title>Phil.</title> 1. 10.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">parakalei=n</lemma>, infinitive after <foreign lang="greek">le/gw</foreign> in the sense of &lsquo;to bid,&rsquo; as fairly often.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">au)tou/s</lemma>, almost pleonastic, but serves to emphasise <foreign lang="greek">ta\ oi)kei=a. au)tou\s ta\ au(tw=n</foreign> would express the same idea in a commoner form.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">toi=s e)n *xerronh/sw|</lemma>, Diopeithes and his mercenaries. These recommendations are repeated with little alteration from the speech on the Chersonese (&sect; 76).</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">sugkalei=n k.t.e(.</lemma> The four infinitives are to be read in two pairs, and <foreign lang="greek">suna/gein</foreign>, which adds nothing to the sense, is inserted simply to give this effect of balance.

<div2 type="section" n="74">
<p> Chalcis and Megara are mentioned as the only states in Greece actually in alliance with Athens.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)gaphto/n</lemma>, &lsquo;a thing to be content with,&rsquo; &lsquo;all that can be hoped.&rsquo;</p>

The insertion of <foreign lang="greek">kai\ kate/lipon</foreign> makes a more striking dislocation here than the similar one in &sect; 73, since <foreign lang="greek">kate/lipon</foreign>, being construed with the emphatic <foreign lang="greek">u(mi=n</foreign>, is more conspicuous than <foreign lang="greek">e)kth/santo</foreign>.
</p></div2>
<div2 type="section" n="75">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ou) mh/pote</lemma>. S gives <foreign lang="greek">ou)de\ mhp.</foreign>, but it does not appear that any satisfactory explanation of <foreign lang="greek">ou)de\</foreign> could be given here. Cf. <title>Phil.</title> 1. 44.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ge/nhtai</lemma>. Some good MSS. have <foreign lang="greek">genh/setai</foreign>, which would be equally legitimate. After verbs of fearing and the like <foreign lang="greek">o(/pws mh\</foreign> is occasionally used in place of the simple <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign>, without any difference being made thereby in the meaning or construction.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">do/cei</lemma> gives the conditional relative clause a &lsquo;particular&rsquo; character: <foreign lang="greek">do/ceie</foreign>, which is equally permissible and has almost as good MS. authority, would make it indefinite. This sentence is in form an inversion of the last words of <title>Phil.</title> 1, though the sense is the same.</p></div2></div1>
