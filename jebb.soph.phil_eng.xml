<p>On the eastern coast of Greece, just north of Thermopylae, <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The home of Philoctetes</note> lies a region which in ancient times was called Malis, &lsquo;the sheep-land.&rsquo; This was the country of Philoctetes,&mdash;the home to which, in the play of Sophocles, his thoughts are constantly turning<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">The Homeric Catalogue includes this district in Phthia, the realm of Achilles (<bibl n="Hom. Il. 2.682"><title>Il.</title> 2. 682</bibl>). It assigns Philoctetes to a more northerly part of Thessaly,&mdash;viz., the narrow and mountainous strip of coast, N. and  E. of the Pagasaean Gulf, which was known in historical times as Magnesia. His four towns were Methon&egrave;, Thaumacia, Meliboea and Olizon. ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 2.716"> <title>Il.</title> 2. 716</bibl> f.) This agrees with the fact that Poeas, the father of Philoctetes, was called the son of Thaumacus, and was numbered among the Argonauts who sailed from Iolcus ( <bibl n="Apollod. 1.9.16">Apollod.  1. 9. 16</bibl>). In its original form, the story of Poeas and his son must have belonged, like that of Jason, to the legends of the Minyae who dwelt on the eastern coasts of Thessaly. Cp. Anthol. append. 61 (vol. II. p. 754 ed. Jacobs): <quote lang="greek">to/cwn *(hrakle/ous tami/hn, *poia/ntion ui(o/n, h(/de *filokth/thn gh= *minua\s kate/xei</quote>. It was when the myth became interwoven with the apotheosis of Heracles that the home of Poeas was transferred to the country around Trachis.</note>. It will be well to form some idea of its chief features and associations.
<!-- there's a map in this paragraph, placed after "snowy" --></p>
<p>Pindus, the spine of northern Greece, terminates at the south in Typhrestus, a great pyramidal height from which two mountain-ranges branch out towards the eastern sea. One of these is Othrys, which skirts the southern border of Thessaly; the other, south of it, is Oeta, which, like Malis, takes its name from its pastures. The deep and broad depression between them is the fertile valley of the Spercheius (the &lsquo;hurrying&rsquo; or &lsquo;vehement&rsquo;) &mdash;which rises at the foot of Typhrestus, and flows into the Malian Gulf. A few miles from the sea, the valley opens. While Othrys continues its eastward direction, Oeta recedes southward, and then, with a sudden bend to the south-east,  sweeps down upon Thermopylae, where the fir-clad and snowy summit of Callidromus rises above the pass. Precipitous cliffs are thrown forward from this part of the Oetaean range, forming an irregular crescent round the southern and western sides of the plain. These cliffs were called of old &lsquo;the Trachinian Rocks.&rsquo; Trachis, the &lsquo;city of the crags,&rsquo; stood on a rocky spur beneath them, a little north of the point where they are cleft by the magnificent gorge of the Asopus,&mdash;that steep ravine by which Hydarnes led his Persians up through the mountain oak-woods, on the night before he surprised Leonidas. Between the Asopus and the Spercheius are the narrow channels of two lesser streams, anciently known as the Melas and the Dyras<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">The Dyras was said to have first started from the ground in order to relieve the fiery pangs of Heracles ( <bibl n="Hdt. 7. 198">Her.  7. 198</bibl>). In a vase-painting noticed below (n. on v. 728, p. 121, 1st col.), the Nymph who seeks to quench the pyre probably symbolises this stream. The ancient mouth of the Spercheius was some miles N. W. of Thermopylae; the present mouths are a little E.N. E. of it, and the line of the coast has been considerably advanced, so that there is no longer a narrow pass. The Asopus, Melas and Dyras formerly had separate courses to the sea. They are now mere affluents of the Spercheius,&mdash;the Melas and Dyras uniting before they reach it.</note>. The name Malis denoted this whole seaboard plain, with the heights around it, from the lower spurs of Othrys on the north to those of Oeta on the south and west. Just opposite the entrance of the Gulf, the bold north-west promontory of Euboea, once called Cape Cenaeum, runs out towards the mainland. There was a peculiar fitness in the phrase of Sophocles, when he described this district, with its varied scenery, as &lsquo;the haunt of Malian Nymphs<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ">v. 725 <quote lang="greek">au)la\n *malia/dwn numfa=n</quote>.</note>,&rsquo;  those beings of the forest and the river, of the hills and the sea.</p>
<p>It was in this region that legend placed the last deeds of Heracles, and his death, or rather his passage from earth to Olympus. After taking Oechalia in Euboea, he was sacrificing on Cape Cenaeum when the fatal robe did its work. He was carried to his home at Trachis; and then he commanded that he should be borne to the top of Mount Oeta, sacred to Zeus, and burnt alive. He was obeyed; as the flames arose on the mountain, they were answered from heaven by the blaze of lightning and the roll of thunder; and by that sign his companions knew that the spirit of the great warrior had been welcomed to the home of his immortal father. Somewhere in the wilds of those lonely summits tradition showed the sacred spot known as &lsquo;the Pyre&rsquo;; and once, at least, in later days a Roman Consul, turning aside from a victorious progress, went up to visit the solemn place where the most Roman of Greek heroes had received the supreme reward of fortitude<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">Manius Acilius Glabrio, after taking Heracleia near Trachis, in the war with Antiochus (191 B.C.). Livy 36. 30: ipse Oetam ascendit, Herculique sacrificium fecit in eo loco quem Pyram, quod ibi mortale corpus eius dei sit crematum, appellant. Cp. Silius Italicus 6. 452: Vixdum clara dies summa lustrabat in Oeta &verbar; Herculei monimenta rogi.&mdash;The name Pyra seems to have been usually associated with a height about eight miles W.N.W. of Trachis.</note>.

<p>Heracles had constrained his son Hyllus to aid in pre- <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The legend in epic poetry.</note> paring the funeral-pile, but could not prevail upon him to kindle it. That office was performed, at his urgent prayer, by the youthful Philoctetes, son of Poeas, king of Malis<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ">With regard to the other version, according to which Poeas was the kindler, see on v. 802.</note>. In token of gratitude, Heracles bequeathed to Philoctetes the bow and arrows which he himself had received from Apollo.</p>
<p>In the myths relating to the Trojan war a most important part belonged to the man who had thus inherited the invincible weapons. Homer, indeed, does not say much about him; but the <title>Iliad</title> contains only an episode in the tenth year of the war: the part played by Philoctetes came before and after that moment. The allusion in the Second Book of the <title>Iliad</title> is,  however, significant; it glances backwards and forwards. He is there mentioned as a skilful archer, who had sailed from Greece in command of seven ships, but had been left behind in Lemnos, wounded by the bite of a deadly water-snake. And then the poet adds that the Greeks at Troy will soon have cause to bethink them of Philoctetes<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ"> <bibl n="Hom.

The events preceding the action of the <title>Iliad</title> were contained in the <title>Cypria</title>, an epic whose reputed author, Stas&icirc;nus of Cyprus, lived early in the eighth century B.C. That poem described how Philoctetes was bitten by the snake,&mdash;while the Greeks, on their way to Troy, were at Tenedos,&mdash;and was abandoned in Lemnos. His later fortunes were narrated in the <title>Little Iliad</title>, ascribed to Lesches of Mitylene (<emph>circa</emph> 700 B.C.), and in the <title>Iliupersis</title>, or &lsquo;Sack of Troy,&rsquo; by Arct&icirc;nus of Miletus (<emph>c.</emph> 776 B.C.). The contents of these lost works are known chiefly from the prose summaries of the grammarian Proclus (140 A.D. ), as partly preserved by Photius in his <title>Bibliotheca.</title> The following is an outline of the story in its epic form.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cis3" type="section" n="3">
<p>When the Greeks under Agamemnon were about to sail against Troy, it became known that an oracle had commanded them to offer sacrifice, in the course of their voyage across the Aegean, at the altar of a deity named Chrys&egrave;. All the accounts placed this altar somewhere in the north-east of the Archipelago. The prevalent version assigned it to a small island which, like the deity herself, was called Chrys&egrave;, and lay close to the eastern shore of Lemnos. Jason, it was said, had sacrificed at this altar when he was leading the Argonauts in quest of the golden fleece. Heracles had paid it a like homage when he was levying war against Laomedon. </p>
<p>Philoctetes, with his seven ships, was in the fleet of Agamemnon, and undertook to act as guide. He alone knew where the isle of Chrys&egrave; was to be found; for, in his early youth, he had been present at the sacrifice offered there by Heracles.</p>
<p>The altar stood in a sacred precinct, under the open sky. When, followed by the Greek chieftains, he approached it, he was bitten in the foot by a serpent. The wound mortified, and became noisome. His cries of pain made it impossible to perform the religious rites, which required the absence of all ill-omened sounds. The fetid odour of his wound also made his presence a distress to the chiefs. They conveyed him from the islet of Chrys&egrave; to the neighbouring coast of Lemnos, where they put him ashore; and then sailed for Troy.</p>
<p>It should be noticed that the circumstances of this desertion, as set forth in the early legend, were probably less inhuman than they appear in the version adopted by Sophocles. In the first place, it can hardly be doubted that these cyclic poets, like Homer, imagined Lemnos as an inhabited island<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">See commentary on v. 2.</note> And, according to one account, some followers of Philoctetes were left in charge of him<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ">Philostratus <title>Heroica</title> 6: <quote lang="greek">ta\ de\ th=s no/sou kai\ tw=n i)asame/nwn au)to\n e(te/rws le/gei</quote> (<quote lang="greek">*prwtesi/laos</quote>). <quote lang="greek">kataleifqh=nai me\n ga\r e)n *lh/mnw| to\n *filokth/thn, ou) mh\n e)/rhmon tw=n qerapeuso/ntwn ou)d' a)perrimme/non tou= *(ellhnikou=: pollou/s te ga\r tw=n *meli/boian oi)kou/ntwn cugkatamei=nai</quote> (<quote lang="greek">strathgo\s de\ tou/twn h)=n</quote>), <quote lang="greek">toi=s t' *)axaioi=s da/krua e)pelqei=n, o(/t' a)pe/lipe sfa=s a)nh\r polemiko\s kai\ pollw=n a)nta/cios</quote>. As to Meliboea, see above, &sect; 1 n. 1.</note>.</p>
<p>Ten years elapsed. The sufferer was still languishing in Lemnos; his former comrades were still on the shore of the Hellespont, besieging the city which they could not capture. Achilles had already fallen; Ajax had died by his own hand. In their despondency, the Atreidae turned to the prophet who had so often admonished or consoled them; but Calchas replied that the fate of Ilium must now be learned from other lips than his. They must consult the Trojan Helenus, son of Priam,&mdash;a warrior whom they had often seen in the front of battle on the plain; a seer who, as rumour told, had warned, though he could not save, his brother Hector. </p>
<p>Helenus was made prisoner by a stratagem of Odysseus, and then declared that, before the Greeks could prevail, two things must be done. First, Philoctetes must be brought back from Lemnos: Troy could never fall, until he launched against it the arrows of Heracles. Secondly, Neoptolemus, the youthful son of Achilles, must come from the island of Scyros, and must receive his due heritage, the wondrous armour wrought for his father by the god Hephaestus.</p>
<p>Both injunctions were obeyed. Diomedes went to Lemnos, and brought Philoctetes. Odysseus went to Scyros, and brought Neoptolemus. Philoctetes was healed by the physician Machaon, son of Asclepius. He then slew Paris in single combat, and shared with Neoptolemus the glory of final victory over Troy.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Characteristics of the epic version.</note></p></div2>
<div2 id="cis4" type="section" n="4">
<p>In this epic form of the story, two points deserve remark. (1) The mission to Lemnos and the mission to Scyros are entrusted to different persons, and are conceived as simultaneous, or nearly so. In the <title>Little Iliad</title> of Lesches, the voyage to Lemnos seems to have been related first. (2) Diomedes has apparently no difficulty in persuading Philoctetes to accompany him. For the purposes of epic narrative, it would evidently suffice that Diomedes should announce an oracle which promised health to the sufferer and honour to the exile. The epic Philoctetes would accept these overtures in a speech of dignified magnanimity; and all would be happily settled. This particular point is curiously illustrated by Quintus Smyrnaeus, though in other respects he has varied widely from the old epic version. He represents the wrath of Philoctetes as immediately disarmed by the first soothing words of the Greek envoys (Diomedes and Odysseus). Indeed, that brevity which sometimes marks the poet of Smyrna is seldom quainter than in this passage of his ninth book. At verse 398 Philoctetes is preparing to shoot his visitors. At verse 426 they are carrying their recovered friend, with pleasant laughter, to their ship:&mdash;
</p>
<p><quote lang="greek">oi( de/ min ai)=y' e)pi\ nh=a kai\ h)i+o/nas barudou/pous kagxalo/wntes e)/neikan o(mw=s sfete/roisi bele/mnois</quote>. 
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cis5" type="section" n="5">
<p>But all this was changed when Philoctetes became a <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The story as a theme for drama.</note> subject of tragic drama. The very essence of the situation, as a theme for Tragedy, was the terrible disadvantage at which the irony of fate had placed the Greeks. Here was a brave and loyal man, guiltless of offence, whom they had banished from their company,&mdash;whom they had even condemned to long years of extreme suffering,&mdash;because a misfortune,&mdash;incurred by him in the course of doing them a service,&mdash;had rendered his person disagreeable to them. For ten years he had been pining on Lemnos; and now they learned that their miserable victim was the arbiter of their destinies. It was not enough if, by force or fraud, they could acquire his bow. The oracle had said that the bow must be used at Troy by Philoctetes himself. How could he be induced to give this indispensable aid?</p>
<p>A dramatist could not glide over this difficulty with the facile eloquence of an epic poet. If the Lemnian outcast was to be brought, in all his wretchedness, before the eyes of the spectators, nature and art alike required the inference that such misery had driven the iron into his soul. It would seem a violation of all probability if, when visited at last by an envoy from the camp, he was instantly conciliated by a promise&mdash;be the sanction what it might&mdash;that, on going to Troy, he would be healed, and would gain a victory of which the profit would be shared by the authors of his past woes. Rather the Philoctetes of drama would be conceived as one to whom the Greeks at Troy were objects of a fixed mistrust, and their leaders, of an invincible abhorrence; one to whom their foes were friends, and their disasters, consolations; one who could almost think that his long agony had been an evil dream, if he could but hear that they were utterly overthrown, and that it was once more possible for him. without misgiving or perplexity, to recognise the justice of the gods<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">See, <foreign lang="la">e.g.</foreign>, in this play, vv. 451 f., 631 f., 1043 f.</note>.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cis6" type="section" n="6">
<p>Aeschylus, Euripides, and Sophocles&mdash;to place their <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The three great dramatists.</note> names in the chronological order of their plays on this subject&mdash; solved the problem each in his own manner. A comparison of their methods is interesting. That it is possible, is due in great  measure to a fortunate accident. Dion, surnamed the goldenmouthed, eminent as a rhetorician and essayist, was born at Prusa in Bithynia about the middle of the first century, and eventually settled at Rome, where he enjoyed the favour of  Nerva and of Trajan. The eighty &lsquo;discourses&rsquo; (<quote lang="greek">lo/goi</quote>) extant under his name are partly orations, partly short pieces in the nature of literary essays,&mdash;many of them very slight, and written in an easy, discursive style. In one of these (no. LII.) he describes how he spent a summer afternoon in reading the story of Philoctetes at Lemnos, as dramatised by Aeschylus, Euripides, and Sophocles. He reflects that, even if he had lived at Athens in their time, he could not have enjoyed precisely this treat,&mdash;of hearing the three masters, one after another, on the same theme. And, as the result of his perusal, he declares that, if he had been a sworn judge in the Dionysiac theatre, it would have puzzled him to award the prize. After such a preface, it is rather disappointing that he does not tell us more about the two plays which are lost. However, his little essay, which fills scarcely seven octavo pages, throws light on several points of interest; and in another of his short pieces (LIX.) he gives a prose paraphrase of the opening scene in the <title>Philoctetes</title> of Euripides. Apart from these two essays of Dion, the fragments of the plays themselves would not help us far. From the Aeschylean play, less than a dozen lines remain; from the Euripidean, about thirty-five. Such, then, are the principal materials for a comparison.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The <title>Philoctetes</title> of Aeschylus.</note></p></div2>
<div2 id="cis7" type="section" n="7">
<p>In the play of Aeschylus, the task of bringing Philoctetes from Lemnos to Troy was undertaken, not by Diomedes,&mdash; as in the epic version,&mdash;but by Odysseus. This change at once strikes the key-note of the theme, as Tragedy was to handle it. Odysseus was the man of all others whom Philoctetes detested; no envoy more repulsive to him could have been found. On the other hand, the choice of that wily hero for the mission implies that its success was felt to depend on the use of stratagem. As Dion shows us, Aeschylus boldly brought Odysseus face to face with Philoctetes, and required the spectators to believe that Philoctetes did not recognise his old enemy. The excuse which Dion suggests for this improbability is not that the appearance  of Odysseus was greatly altered, but that the memory of Philoctetes had been impaired by ten years of suffering. It may be inferred that the text of Aeschylus supplied no better explanation.</p>
<p>The unrecognised Odysseus then proceeded to win the ear of Philoctetes by a false story of misfortunes to the Greeks at Troy; Agamemnon was dead; Odysseus, too, was gone&mdash;having been put to death for an atrocious crime (Dion does not say what): and the whole army was in extremities. This story having won the confidence of Philoctetes, the Aeschylean Odysseus perhaps seized the arms while the sick man was in a paroxysm of his disease. A fragment indicates that Aeschylus described the bow as hanging on a pine-tree near the cave. How Philoctetes was finally brought away, we do not know: but it may be assumed that there was no <emph>deus ex machina</emph>, and also that Odysseus had no accomplice. The play probably belonged to a period when Aeschylus had not yet adopted the third actor. Inhabitants of the island formed the Chorus. These Lemnians, Dion says, vouchsafed no apology for having left Philoctetes unvisited during ten years; and he told them his whole story, as if it were new to them. But, as the essayist adds, the unfortunate are always ready to speak of their troubles, and we may charitably suppose that some Lemnians had occasionally cheered his solitude.</p>
<p>The general impression made on Dion's mind by the play of Aeschylus was that of a simplicity and dignity suitable to ideal Tragedy. It had an austere grandeur of diction and of sentiment which sustained the characters on the heroic level<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">Dion or. 52 &sect; 4 <quote lang="greek">h(/ te ga\r tou= *ai)sxu/lou megalofrosu/nh kai\ to\ a)rxai=on, e)/ti de\ to\ au)/qades</quote> (&lsquo;rugged boldness&rsquo;) <quote lang="greek">th=s dianoi/as kai\ th=s fra/sews pre/ponta e)fai/neto tragw|di/a| kai\ toi=s palaioi=s h)/qesi tw=n h(rw/wn: ou)de\n e)pibebouleume/non ou)de\ stwmu/lon ou)de\ tapeino/n</quote>.

<p>The <title>Philoctetes</title> of Euripides was produced in 431 B.C.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ">Argum.   The <title>Medea</title>, <title>Philoctetes</title> and <title>Dictys</title> formed a trilogy, with the <title>Theristae</title> as satyric drama.</note>, <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The <title>Philoctetes</title> of Euripides.</note> &mdash;some forty years or more, perhaps, after that of Aeschylus.  Euripides combined the epic precedent with the Aeschylean by sending Diomedes along with Odysseus to Lemnos. A soliloquy by Odysseus opened the play<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">Dion's 59th discourse bears the title <quote lang="greek">*f*i*l*o*k*t*h*t*h*s. *e*s*t*i *d*e *p*a*r*a*f*r*a*s*i*s</quote>. It is simply a prose paraphrase&mdash;without preface or comment&mdash;of the soliloquy and the subsequent dialogue, down to the point at which Philoctetes invites Odysseus to enter his cave. Although it would be easy to turn Dion's prose into iambics (as Bothe and others have done), it is evident that, at least in several places, the paraphrase has been a free one. The whole passage, in its original form, cannot have been much shorter than the <quote lang="greek">pro/logos</quote> in the play of Sophocles.</note>. The astute warrior was in a highly nervous state of mind. &lsquo;Such,&rsquo; he said in effect, &lsquo;are the consequences of ambition! I might have stayed at Troy, with a reputation secured; but the desire of increasing it has brought me here to Lemnos, where I am in great danger of losing it altogether, by failing in this most ticklish business.&rsquo; He then explained that, when the Atreidae had first proposed the mission to him, he had declined, because he knew that all his resources of persuasion would be thrown away on Philoctetes, the man to whom he had done a wrong so terrible. His first appearance would be the signal for an arrow from the unerring bow. But afterwards his guardian goddess Athena had appeared to him in a dream, and had told him that, if he would go to Lemnos, she would change his aspect and his voice, so that his enemy should not know him. Thus reassured, he had undertaken the task. We note in passing that Euripides was here indirectly criticising Aeschylus, who had assumed that Odysseus could escape recognition. The device of Athena's intervention was borrowed from the <title>Odyssey</title>, where she similarly transforms her favourite at need. But Euripides, in his turn, invites the obvious comment that such a device was more suitable to epic narrative than to drama<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ">In the <title>Ajax</title>, Athena makes Odysseus invisible to the hero (v. 85); but Ajax is already frenzied; and the scene is short.</note>.</p>
<p>Continuing his soliloquy, Odysseus said that, as he had reason to know, a rival embassy was coming to Philoctetes from the Trojans, who hoped by large promises to gain him for their side. Here, then, was a crisis that demanded all his energies. At this moment, he saw Philoctetes approaching, and, with a hasty prayer to Athena, prepared to meet him.  Philoctetes limped slowly forward,&mdash;clad (according to Dion's paraphrase) in the skins of wild beasts which he had shot<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">Dion or. 59 &sect; 5 (Odysseus speaks): <quote lang="greek">dorai\ qhri/wn kalu/ptousin au)to/n</quote>.

But you are welcome to share his wretched abode, until you can find some better resource.&rsquo; Philoctetes then invited his new friend into his cave.</p>
<p>Presently the Chorus entered,&mdash;composed, as in the Aeschylean play, of Lemnians. They began by excusing themselves for their long neglect of the sufferer. This was another glance at Aeschylus, whose Lemnians had made no such apologies. As the judicious Dion says, however, that was perhaps the wiser course. But Euripides had a further expedient for redeeming the character of the islanders; he introduced a Lemnian called Actor, who had occasionally visited the sick man<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="4" resp="RCJ">Dion or. 52 &sect; 8 <quote lang="greek">o( *eu)ripi/dhs to\n *)/aktora</quote> [MSS. <quote lang="greek">*(/ektora</quote>] <quote lang="greek">ei)sa/gei e(/na *lhmni/wn w(s gnw/rimon tw=| *filokth/th| prosio/nta kai\ polla/kis sumbeblhko/ta</quote>.

And Dion's description of Actor as <quote lang="greek">e(/na *lhmni/wn</quote> would apply to a shepherd better than to a king.

The climax of dramatic interest must have been marked  by the arrival of that Trojan embassy which Odysseus had foreshadowed in the prologue. It came, probably, before the seizure of the bow, and while, therefore, Odysseus was still disguised. Two verses, spoken by him in the play, run thus:&mdash;
</p>
<p><quote lang="greek">u(pe/r ge me/ntoi panto\s *(ellh/nwn stratou= ai)sxro\n siwpa=n barba/rous d' e)a=n le/gein</quote><note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">The first of these two verses is preserved by   <bibl n="Plut. Adv. Col. 1108b">Plut. <title>Mor.</title> 1108</bibl>B, who from the second v. quotes only <quote lang="greek">ai)sxro\n siwpa=n</quote>. The second v. was made proverbial by Aristotle's parody (<quote lang="greek">ai)sxro\n siwpa=n *)isokra/thn d' e)a=n le/gein</quote>). That the original word was <quote lang="greek">barba/rous</quote> appears from  <emph>Cic. de orat.</emph> 3. 35. 141; where, as in Quintil. 3. 1. 14, it is called &lsquo;a verse from the <title>Philoctetes.</title>&rsquo; That this was the play of Euripides, is a certain inference from the fact of the Trojan embassy.</note>.</p>
<p>Such words would be fitting in the mouth of a Greek speaker who pretended to have been wronged by his countrymen. They suggest a context of the following kind;&mdash;&lsquo;(Although I have been badly treated by the Greek chiefs,) yet, in the cause of the Greek army at large, I cannot be silent, while barbarians plead.&rsquo; The leader of the Trojan envoys&mdash;perhaps Paris&mdash;would urge Philoctetes to become their ally. Then the appeal to Hellenic patriotism would be made with striking effect by one who alleged that, like Philoctetes himself, he had personal injuries to forget. This scene would end with the discomfiture and withdrawal of the Trojan envoys. It may be conjectured that the subsequent course of the action was somewhat as follows. Philoctetes was seized with an attack of his malady; the disguised Odysseus, assisted perhaps by the Lemnian shepherd, was solicitous in tending him; and meanwhile Diomedes, entering at the back of the group, contrived to seize the bow. Odysseus then revealed himself, and, after a stormy scene, ultimately prevailed on Philoctetes to accompany him. His part would here give scope for another great speech, setting forth the promises of the oracle. Whether Athena intervened at the close, is uncertain.</p>
<p>This play of Euripides struck Dion as a masterpiece of declamation, and as a model of ingenious debate,&mdash;worthy of study, indeed, as a practical lesson in those arts. When he speaks of the &lsquo;contrast&rsquo; to the play of Aeschylus, he is thinking  of these qualities<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ"> <bibl n="Eur. Orest. 52"> Or. 52</bibl>&sect; 11 <quote lang="greek">w(/sper a)nti/strofo/s e)sti th=| tou= *ai)sxu/lou, politikwta/th kai\ r(htorikwta/th ou)=sa k.t.l.</quote> So, again, he speaks of the <quote lang="greek">e)nqumh/mata politika/</quote> used by Odysseus: of the <quote lang="greek">i)ambei=a safw=s kai\ kata\ fu/sin kai\ politikw=s e)/xonta</quote>: and of the whole play as marked by <quote lang="greek">to\ a)kribe\s kai\ drimu\ kai\ politiko/n</quote>. The word <quote lang="greek">politiko/s</quote> is here used in the special sense which Greek writers on rhetoric had given to it. By <quote lang="greek">politiko\s lo/gos</quote> they meant public speaking as distinguished from scholastic exercises,&mdash;especially speaking in a deliberative assembly or a law-court. See <title>Attic Orators</title>, vol. I. p. 90. Dion's reiteration of the word marks his feeling that the rhetorical dialectic of Euripides in this play would have been telling in the contests of real life. And hence the play is described by him as <quote lang="greek">toi=s e)ntugxa/nousi plei/sthn w)fe/leian parasxei=n duname/nh</quote>,&mdash;&lsquo;to those who engage in discussion.&rsquo; For this use of <quote lang="greek">e)ntugxa/nein</quote>, cp.   <bibl n="Aristot.

Rh. 1.1.12">Arist. <title>Rhet.</title> 1. 1. 12</bibl>, with Cope's note.</note>. With regard to the plot, no student of Euripides will be at a loss to name the trait which is most distinctive of his hand. It is the invention of the Trojan embassy,&mdash;a really brilliant contrivance for the purpose which he had in view. We cannot wonder if, in the period of classical antiquity during which controversial rhetoric chiefly flourished, the <title>Philoctetes</title> of Euripides was more generally popular than either of its rivals.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cis9" type="section" n="9">
<p>The originality of Sophocles can now be estimated. <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Sophocles.</note> Hitherto, one broad characteristic had been common to epic and dramatic treatments of the subject. The fate of Philoctetes had been considered solely as it affected the Greeks at Troy. The oracle promised victory to them, if they could regain him: to him it offered health and glory. This was an excellent prospect for him: if he would not embrace it voluntarily, he must, if possible, be compelled to submission. But there had been no hint that, outside of this prospect, he had any claim on human pity. Suppose him to say,&mdash;&lsquo;I refuse health and glory, at the price of rejoining the men who cast me forth to worse than death; but I pray to be delivered from this misery, and restored to my home in Greece.&rsquo; Would not that be a warrantable choice, a reasonable prayer? Not a choice or a prayer, perhaps, that could win much sympathy from a Diomedes or an Odysseus, men who had consented to the act of desertion, and who now had their own objects to gain. But imagine some one in whom a generous nature, or even an ordinary sense of justice and humanity, could work without hindrance from self-interest;&mdash;  might not such a man be moved by the miseries of Philoctetes, and recognise that he had human rights which were not extinguished by his refusal to obey the summons of the Atreidae?</p>
<p>Again, the two plays on this subject which Sophocles found existing, both depended, for their chief dramatic interest, on the successful execution of a plan laid by the envoys. The Odysseus of Aeschylus, the Odysseus and Diomedes of Euripides, alike carry a stratagem to a triumphant issue.</p>
<p>In associating Odysseus with Neoptolemus, the youthful son of Achilles, Sophocles chose the person who, if any change was to be made in that respect, might most naturally be suggested by the epic version of the fable. But this new feature was no mere variation on the example of his predecessors. It prepared the way for a treatment of the whole story which was fundamentally different from theirs.</p>
<p>This will best be shown by a summary of the plot. The events supposed to have occurred before the commencement of the play can be told in a few words. Achilles having fallen, his armour had been awarded to Odysseus, and Ajax had committed suicide. Then Helenus had declared the oracle (as related above, &sect; 3). Phoenix and Odysseus had gone to Scyros, and had brought the young Neoptolemus thence to Troy; where his father's armour was duly given to him. (In his false story to Philoctetes, he represents the Atreidae as having defrauded him of it.) Then he set out with Odysseus for Lemnos,&mdash;knowing that the object was to bring Philoctetes, but not that any deceit was to be used. The chiefs had told him that he himself was destined to take Troy; but not that the aid of Philoctetes was an indispensable condition.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Analysis of the play. I. Prologue: 1&mdash;134.</note></p></div2>
<div2 id="cis10" type="section" n="10">
<p>The scene is laid on the lonely north-east coast of Lemnos. Odysseus and Neoptolemus have just landed, and have now walked along the shore to a little distance from their ships<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">Odysseus comes in one ship, and Neoptolemus in another. Each chief has his own men. Hence Odysseus can threaten to sail at once, leaving Neoptolemus behind, and denounce him to the Greek army (1257 f.). And Neoptolemus can propose to sail with Philoctetes, but without Odysseus, for Malis (1402 ff.). Where the singular <quote lang="greek">nau=s</quote> is used, with or without the definite article, it refers to the ship of Neoptolemus (<foreign lang="la">e.g.</foreign> 125, 461, 527, 881, 1076, 1180).</note>, which are no longer visible. Odysseus tells his young  comrade that here, long ago, he put Philoctetes ashore, by command of the Atreidae. He desires the youth to examine the rocks which rise above their heads, and to look for a cave, with a spring near it. Neoptolemus presently finds the cave, with traces in it which show that it is still inhabited.</p>
<p>A seaman, in attendance on Neoptolemus, is then despatched to act as sentry, lest Philoctetes should come on them by surprise.</p>
<p>Odysseus explains that it is impossible for <emph>him</emph> to face Philoctetes; he must remain concealed, on peril of his life; Neoptolemus must conduct the parley. Neoptolemus must tell Philoctetes truly who he is&mdash;but must pretend that he has quarrelled with the Greeks at Troy, for depriving him of his father's arms, and is sailing home to Greece.</p>
<p>The youth at first refuses to utter such a falsehood; but yields at last to the argument that otherwise he cannot take Troy. Odysseus now departs to his ship,&mdash;promising that, after a certain time, he will send an accomplice to help Neoptolemus in working on the mind of Philoctetes. This will be the man who had been acting as sentry; he will be disguised as a sea-captain.</p>
<p>The Chorus of fifteen seamen (from the ship of Neoptolemus) <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Parodos: 135&mdash;218.</note> now enters. They ask their young chief how they are to aid his design. He invites them to look into the cave, and instructs them how they are to act when Philoctetes returns. In answer to their words of pity for the sufferer, he declares his belief that heaven ordains those sufferings only till the hour for Troy to fall shall have come.</p>
<p>Philoctetes appears. He is glad to find that the strangers <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">II. First episode: 219&mdash;675.</note> are Greeks; he is still more rejoiced when he learns that the son of Achilles is before him. He tells his story; and Neoptolemus, in turn, relates his own ill-treatment by the chiefs. The Chorus, in a lyric strophe, confirm their master's fiction. After some further converse about affairs at Troy, Philoctetes implores Neoptolemus to take him home. They are on the point of setting out for their ship, when two men are seen approaching.</p>
<p>The supposed sea-captain (sent by Odysseus) enters, with a sailor from the ship of Neoptolemus. He describes himself as master of a small merchant-vessel, trading in wine between Peparethus (an island off the south coast of Thessaly) and the Greek camp at Troy. He announces that the Greeks have sent emissaries in pursuit of Neoptolemus:&mdash;also that Odysseus and Diomedes have sailed in quest of Philoctetes. He then departs.</p>
<p>Philoctetes is now more anxious than ever to start at once. Accompanied by Neoptolemus, he enters his cave, in order to fetch his few necessaries.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Stasimon: 676&mdash;729.</note>In the choral ode which follows, the seamen give full expression to their pity for Philoctetes. They have heard of Ixion, but they have never seen any doom so fearful as that of this unoffending man.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">III. Second episode: 730&mdash;826.</note>Just as he is leaving the cave with Neoptolemus, Philoctetes is seized with a sharp attack of pain. He vainly seeks to hide his agony. Neoptolemus is touched, and asks what he can do. Philoctetes, feeling drowsy, says that, before he falls asleep, he wishes to place the bow and arrows in his friend's hands. Thus Neoptolemus (still with treason in his heart) gets the bow into his keeping.</p>
<p>A second and sharper paroxysm now comes upon Philoctetes. In his misery, he prays for death&mdash;he beseeches his friend to cast him into the crater of the burning mountain which can be seen from the cave. Neoptolemus is deeply moved. He solemnly promises that he will not leave the sick man; who presently sinks into slumber.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Kommos (taking the place of a second stasimon): 827&mdash;864.</note>Invoking the Sleep-god to hold Philoctetes prisoner, the Chorus urge Neoptolemus to desert the sleeper, and quit Lemnos with the bow. Neoptolemus replies that such a course would be as futile as base,&mdash;since the oracle had directed them to bring not only the bow, but its master.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">IV. Third episode: 865&mdash;1080.</note>Philoctetes awakes, and, aided by Neoptolemus, painfully rises to his feet. They are ready to set out for their ship. And  now Neoptolemus has reached the furthest point to which the deception can be carried; for at the ships Philoctetes will find Odysseus. Shame and remorse prevail. He tells Philoctetes that their destination is Troy.</p>
<p>The unhappy man instantly demands his bow&mdash;but Neoptolemus refuses to restore it. And then the despair of Philoctetes finds terrible utterance. The youth's purpose is shaken. He is on the point of giving back the weapon, when suddenly Odysseus starts forth from a hiding-place near the cave, and prevents him. Philoctetes&mdash;whom Odysseus threatens to take by force&mdash;is about to throw himself from the cliffs, when he is seized by the attendants. In answer to his bitter reproaches, Odysseus tells him that he can stay in Lemnos, if he chooses:&mdash; other hands can wield the bow at Troy. Odysseus then departs to his ship, ordering his young comrade to follow; but, by the latter's command, the Chorus stay with Philoctetes, in the hope that he may yet change his mind.</p>
<p>In a lyric dialogue, Philoctetes bewails his fate, while the <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Second Kommos (taking the place of a third stasimon): 1081&mdash; 1217.</note> Chorus remind him that it is in his own power to escape from Lemnos. But at the bare hint of Troy, his anger blazes forth, and he bids them depart. They are going, when he frantically recalls them. Once more they urge their counsel&mdash;only to elicit a still more passionate refusal. He craves but one boon of them&mdash;some weapon with which to kill himself.</p>
<p>They are about to leave him&mdash;since no persuasions avail&mdash; <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">V. Exodos: 1218 &mdash;1471.</note> when Neoptolemus is seen hurrying back, with the bow in his hand,&mdash;closely followed by Odysseus, who asks what he means to do. Neoptolemus replies that he intends to restore the bow to its rightful owner. Odysseus remonstrates, blusters, threatens, and finally departs, saying that he will denounce this treason to the army.</p>
<p>The youth next calls forth Philoctetes, and gives him the bow. Odysseus once more starts forth from ambush&mdash;but this time he is too late. The weapon is already in the hands of Philoctetes, who bends it at his foe, and would have shot him, had not Neoptolemus interposed. Odysseus hastily retires, and is not seen again.</p>
<p>Philoctetes now hears from Neoptolemus the purport of the  oracle; he is to be healed, and is to share the glory of taking Troy. He hesitates for a moment&mdash;solely because he shrinks from paining his friend by a refusal. But he cannot bring himself to go near the Atreidae. And so he calls upon Neoptolemus to fulfil his promise&mdash;to take him home.</p>
<p>Neoptolemus consents. He forebodes the vengeance of the Greeks&mdash;but Philoctetes reassures him: the arrows of Heracles shall avert it. They are about to set forth for Greece, when a divine form appears in the air above them.</p>
<p>Heracles has come from Olympus to declare the will of Zeus. Philoctetes must go to Troy with Neoptolemus, there to find health and fame. He yields to the mandate of heaven, brought by one who, while on earth, had been so dear to him. He makes his farewell to Lemnos; and the play closes as he moves with Neoptolemus towards the ships, soon to be sped by a fair wind to Sigeum.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">General scope of the treatment.</note></p></div2>
<div2 id="cis11" type="section" n="11">
<p>Even a mere outline of the plot, such as the above, will serve to exhibit the far-reaching consequences of the change made by Sophocles, when he introduced Neoptolemus as the associate of Odysseus. The man who retains the most indelible memory of a wrong may be one who still preserves a corresponding depth of sensibility to kindness; the abiding resentment can coexist with undiminished quickness of gratitude for benefits, and with loyal readiness to believe in the faith of promises. Such is the Philoctetes of Sophocles; he has been cast forth by comrades whom he was zealously aiding; his occasional visitors have invariably turned a deaf ear to his prayers; but, inexorably as he hates the Greek chiefs, all the ten years in Lemnos have not made him a Timon. He is still generous, simple, large-hearted, full of affection for the friends and scenes of his early days; the young stranger from the Greek camp, who shows pity for him, at once wins his warmest regard, and receives proofs of his absolute confidence. It is the combination of this character with heroic fortitude under misery that appeals with such irresistible pathos to the youthful son of Achilles, and gradually alters his resolve. But this character could never have been unfolded except in a sympathetic presence. The disclosure is  possible only because Neoptolemus himself, a naturally frank and chivalrous spirit, is fitted to invite it. In converse with Diomedes or Odysseus, only the sterner aspects of Philoctetes would have appeared.</p>
<p>Nor, again, was it dramatically possible that Diomedes or Odysseus should regard Philoctetes in any other light than that of an indispensable ally: they must bring him to Troy, if possible: if not, then he must remain in Lemnos. Hence neither Aeschylus nor Euripides could have allowed the scheme of Odysseus to fail; for then not even a <emph>deus ex machina</emph> could have made the result satisfactory. It was only a person like Neoptolemus, detached from the past policy of the chiefs, who could be expected to view Philoctetes simply as a wronged and suffering man, with an unconditional claim to compassion. The process by which this view of him gains upon the mind of Neoptolemus, and finally supersedes the desire of taking him to Troy, is delineated with marvellous beauty and truth. Odysseus is baffled; but the decree of Zeus, whose servant he called himself, is performed. The supernatural agency of Heracles is employed in a strictly artistic manner, because the dead-lock of motives has come about by a natural process: the problem now is how to reconcile human piety, as represented by the decision of Neoptolemus, with the purpose of the gods, as declared in the oracle of Helenus. Only a divine message could bend the will of Philoctetes, or absolve the conscience of the man who had promised to bring him home.</p>
<p>Thus it is by the introduction of Neoptolemus that Sophocles is enabled to invest the story with a dramatic interest of the deepest kind. It is no longer only a critical episode in the Trojan war, turning on the question whether the envoys of the Greeks can conciliate the master of their fate. It acquires the larger significance of a pathetic study in human character,&mdash; a typical illustration of generous fortitude under suffering, and of the struggle between good and evil in an ambitious but loyal mind. Dion, in his comparison of the three plays on this subject, gives unstinted praise, as we have seen, to the respective merits of Aeschylus and of Euripides; but he reserves for  Sophocles the epithet of &lsquo;most tragic<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ"> <bibl n="Eur.

<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The oracle.</note></p></div2>
<div2 id="cis12" type="section" n="12">
<p>While the general plot of the <title>Philoctetes</title> is simple and lucid, there are some points in it which call for remark.</p>
<p>In the first place, some questions suggest themselves with regard to the oracle which commanded the Greeks to bring Philoctetes from Lemnos. Helenus appears to have said that he must be brought by persuasion, not by force (vv. 612, 1332). Odysseus, indeed, offered to compel him, if necessary (618); and, at one moment, threatens to do so (985). But it would be in keeping with his character&mdash;as depicted in this play&mdash; that he should think it unnecessary to observe the letter of the oracle in this respect. If his stratagem had succeeded, force would have been needless.</p>
<p>Then at v. 1340 Helenus is quoted as saying that Troy is doomed to fall in the summer. The Greeks could understand this only in a conditional sense, since he had told them that their victory depended on the return of Philoctetes (611 f.). But the absolute statement in v. 1340 is intelligible, if the seer be conceived as having a prevision of the event, and therefore a conviction that, by some means, Philoctetes would be brought.</p>
<p>Again,&mdash;is the ignorance of the oracle shown by Neoptolemus at v. 114 inconsistent with the knowledge which he shows afterwards? (197 ff.: 1337 ff.) I think not. The only fact of which v. 114 proves him ignorant is that Troy could not be taken without Philoctetes. What he says afterwards on that point could be directly inferred from what Odysseus then told him (v. 115). He may have known from the first that Philoctetes was a desirable ally, and that, if he came to Troy, he would be healed.</p>
<p>At v. 1055 Odysseus declares his willingness to leave Philoctetes in Lemnos. It is enough that the bow has been captured.  But the oracle had expressly said that Philoctetes himself must be brought (841). Indeed, the difficulty of securing <emph>him</emph> is the basis of the whole story. Therefore, in 1055 ff., Odysseus must be conceived as merely using a last threat, which, he hopes, may cause Philoctetes to yield. The alternative in the mind of Odysseus&mdash;we must suppose&mdash;was to carry him aboard by force. In vv. 1075 ff. Neoptolemus directs the Chorus to stay with Philoctetes&mdash;on the chance of his relenting&mdash;until the ship is ready, and then to come quickly, when called. It would certainly seem from this that Neoptolemus understood his chief as seriously intending to leave Philoctetes behind. And the words of the Chorus at v. 1218 suggest the same thing. But it does not follow that they had penetrated the real purpose of their crafty leader.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cis13" type="section" n="13">
<p>In the opening scene Odysseus orders Neoptolemus <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Episode of the merchant (vv. 542 &mdash;627).</note> to remain at the cave, while he himself returns to his ship. &lsquo;If&rsquo; (he says in effect) &lsquo;you seem to be staying here too long&mdash;that is, if there is reason to fear some hitch in our plan&mdash;then I will send one of your men to the cave, disguised as the captain of a merchant-ship. He will tell an artful story, from which you can take hints.&rsquo; Neoptolemus has already won the confidence of Philoctetes (who believes that he is to be taken home), when this pretended merchant appears (v. 542). Feigning to come from Troy, he reports that Odysseus and Diomedes have sailed for Lemnos in quest of Philoctetes, while other emissaries are in pursuit of Neoptolemus. This story quickens the impatience of Philoctetes to leave Lemnos (v. 635), while it also strengthens his sympathy for the son of Achilles. It brings out, too, the feeling with which he regards the errand of Odysseus. &lsquo;Sooner would I hearken to that deadliest of my foes, the viper which made me the cripple that I am&rsquo; (vv. 631 f.). But the episode has a further result. It supplies a motive for the transfer of the bow. Philoctetes, feeling drowsy after an attack of pain, fears that his enemies may arrive in Lemnos and seize his weapons while he is asleep. He therefore hands the bow and arrows to Neoptolemus, begging him to keep them safe (vv. 763&mdash;773)<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">An able critic in the <bibl><title>Athen&oelig;um</title> (<date value="1892-08-13">Aug. 13, 1892</date>)</bibl> further suggests that the episode of the merchant may serve to explain an obscure point. When Philoctetes discovers that he is to be taken to Troy, he denounces the deceit of Neoptolemus (vv. 927&mdash;962). And yet in v. 1365 he speaks as if he still believed the false story told by Neoptolemus in vv. 343&mdash;390, that he had been defrauded of his father's arms. The apparent inconsistency can be explained (the critic remarks) if Philoctetes supposed that, while he was asleep, Odysseus reached Lemnos, and then for the first time won Neoptolemus to his plans. On this view, in vv. 971 f. (<quote lang="greek">ou)k ei)= kako\s su/, pro\s kakw=n d' a)ndrw=n maqw\n</quote> &verbar; <quote lang="greek">e)/oikas h(/kein ai)sxra/</quote>), <quote lang="greek">h(/kein</quote> must mean, &lsquo;to have come <emph>back</emph>&rsquo; (from a colloquy with Odysseus, held near the spot where Philoctetes was sleeping. But the natural sense of <quote lang="greek">h(/kein</quote> is clearly, &lsquo;to have come <emph>to Lemnos.</emph>&rsquo; And if (notwithstanding his alleged wrong) Neoptolemus could listen to Odysseus in Lemnos, why should he not have become his accomplice before leaving Troy? Another point, however, which the critic notes is independent of this question. Neoptolemus would naturally feel some fresh remorse and shame when he perceived (from v. 1365) that the whole extent of his duplicity was not even then surmised by Philoctetes. And these feelings may have been conceived by the dramatist as motives which helped to determine his final resolve.</note>. </p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The Chorus.</note></p></div2>
<div2 id="cis14" type="section" n="14">
<p>The management of the Chorus deserves notice. If Sophocles had followed the example of Aeschylus and Euripides, he would have composed it of Lemnians. He felt, probably, that it was better to avoid raising the question which was then suggested,&mdash;viz., why some effective succour had not been rendered to Philoctetes in the course of the ten years. But there was a further motive for the change. The attitude of a Lemnian Chorus would be that of a sympathetic visitor, leading Philoctetes to recount his sufferings, and speaking words of comfort in return; while, with respect to the scheme of Odysseus for bringing him to Troy, it would be neutral. But the dramatic effect of the situation is heightened by every circumstance that contributes to the isolation of the central figure. As in the <title>Antigone</title> the heroine is the more forlorn because the Theban elders support Creon, so here the loneliness of Philoctetes becomes more complete when the Chorus is formed of persons attached to the Greek chiefs. In these ten years he has seen no human face, and heard no voice, save when some chance vessel put in at the coast, only to mock him with a gleam of delusive hope. And now he stands alone against all.</p>
<p>The key-note of the part played by the seamen is their wish to second the design of their master, Neoptolemus; but they also feel genuine pity for Philoctetes. This is powerfully expressed in the stasimon (676 ff.), where they are alone upon the scene;  though, at the close of that ode, when the sufferer returns, they once more seek to deceive him with the belief that he is going home to Malis (718 f.). But there is one passage which is in startling discord with the general tone of their utterances: it is where they press Neoptolemus to seize the moment while Philoctetes sleeps, and to decamp with the bow (833 ff.). It would be a poor excuse to suggest that they regard his sleep as the presage of imminent death (861 <quote lang="greek">w(s *)ai+/da| pa/ra kei/menos</quote>). The dramatic motive of this passage is, indeed, evident: it elicits a reproof from Neoptolemus, and illustrates his honourable constancy (839 ff.). As for the Chorus, it may at least be said that this jarring note is struck only once. The humane temper which they had shown up to that point reappears in the sequel.</p>
<p>The Chorus of this play is essentially an active participator in the plot&mdash;aiding the strategy of Neoptolemus, and endeavouring to alter the purpose of Philoctetes (1081&mdash;1217). Hence it is natural that there should be only one stasimon. The other lyrics subsequent to the Parodos either form parentheses in the dialogue (391 ff., 507 ff.), or belong to the <quote lang="greek">kommoi/</quote>.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cis15" type="section" n="15">
<p>It is interesting to compare the Odysseus of this play&mdash; <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Odysseus.</note> one of the poet's latest works&mdash;with that of the <title>Ajax</title>, which was one of the earliest. There, Odysseus appears as one who has deeply taken to heart the lesson of moderation, and of reverence for the gods, taught by Athena's punishment of his rival; and, if there is no great elevation in his character, at least he performs a creditable part in dissuading the Atreidae from refusing burial to the dead. Here, he is found avowing that a falsehood is not shameful, if it brings advantage (v. 109); he can be superlatively honest, he says, when there is a prize for honesty; but his first object is always to gain his end (1049 ff.). He is not content with urging Neoptolemus to tell a lie, but adds a sneer at the youth's reluctance (84 f.). Yet, as we learn from Dion, he is &lsquo;far gentler and simpler&rsquo; than the Odysseus who figured in the <title>Philoctetes</title> of Euripides. The Homeric conception of the resourceful hero had suffered a grievous decline in the later period of the Attic drama; but Sophocles, it would seem, was comparatively lenient to him. </p>
<p>In the <title>Ajax</title>, it will be remembered, Odysseus is terrified at the prospect of meeting his insane foe, and Athena reproves his &lsquo;cowardice&rsquo; (74 f.). His final exit in the <title>Philoctetes</title> is in flight from the bent bow of the hero, who remarks that he is brave only in words (1305 ff.). And, at an earlier moment in the play, he is ironically complimented by Neoptolemus on his prudence in declining to fight (1259). All these passages indicate that the conventional stage Odysseus to whom Attic audiences had become accustomed was something of a poltroon. But it is instructive to remark the delicate reserve of Sophocles in hinting a trait which was so dangerously near to the grotesque. For it is no necessary disparagement to the courage of Odysseus that he should shrink from confronting Ajax,&mdash;a raging maniac intent on killing him,&mdash;or that he should decline to be a target for the &lsquo;unerring&rsquo; shafts of Philoctetes,&mdash;or that he should refrain from drawing his sword on a young comrade, Neoptolemus.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Topography.</note></p></div2>
<div2 id="cis16" type="section" n="16">
<p>A few words must be added concerning the topography of the play<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">A sketch-map of Lemnos is given in the Appendix, note on v. 800.</note>. Mount Hermaeum, which re-echoed the cries of Philoctetes, may safely be identified with the north-eastern promontory of Lemnos, now Cape Plaka. His cave was imagined by the poet as situated in the cliffs on the north-east coast, not far south of Hermaeum (<bibl n="Soph. Phil. 1455">cp. 1455</bibl> ff.), and at some height above the shore (v. 1000: cp. v. 814). The east coast is probably that on which the volcano Mosychlus (visible from the cave) once existed; and the islet called Chrys&egrave; lay near it. Philoctetes describes Lemnos as uninhabited (v. 220), and as affording no anchorage (v. 302). This raises a curious point as to the degree of licence that a dramatist of that age would have allowed himself in a matter of this sort,&mdash;and as to the choice which he would have made between two kinds of improbability. In the time of Sophocles, Lemnos had long been a possession of Athens, and it was a fact familiar to Athenians that the island possessed excellent harbours on every side except the east. Then, if an Athenian audience were required to suppose that, in the heroic age, Lemnos was a desert island, they would at once remember the &lsquo;well-peopled&rsquo; Lemnos of the <title>Iliad.</title> Hence, the  simplest supposition&mdash;viz., that Sophocles chose to make Lemnos desolate for the nonce&mdash;is not really so easy as it might appear. One asks, then, did he mean us to remember, here also, the maimed condition of Philoctetes, who could not move many yards from his cave in the eastern cliffs? The centres of population, in ancient times, were on the west and north coasts. The area of Lemnos has been computed as about a hundred and fifty square miles, or nearly the same as that of the Isle of Wight<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ"><title>Encycl. Brit.</title> (9th ed.) vol. XIV. p. 436: vol. XXIV. p. 561.</note>. It would not, then, be absurd to suppose that, even in the space of many years, no Lemnian had chanced to find that particular spot, at the extreme verge of a desolate region, in which the sick man was esconced.

<div2 id="cis17" type="section" n="17">
<p>The fortunes of the hero after his return to Troy <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Other literature of the subject.</note> formed the subject of another play by Sophocles (<quote lang="greek">*filokth/ths o( e)n *troi/a|</quote>). The healing of Philoctetes, and his slaying of Paris, must have been the principal incidents; but the few words which remain give no clue to the treatment. It is only a conjecture&mdash; though a probable one&mdash;that Asclepius himself was introduced as aiding the skill of his sons<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ">At v. 1437 Heracles promises to send Asclepius to Troy,&mdash;a passage which has groundlessly been regarded as inconsistent with the mention of the Asclepiadae in 1333.

<p>Besides the three great dramatists, other tragic poets of the <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Greek plays.</note> same period wrote on the story of Philoctetes<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="3" resp="RCJ">The <quote lang="greek">*filokth/ths</quote> by Achaeus of Eretria (a contemporary of Sophocles) dealt with the hero's adventures at Troy. See Nauck, <title>Trag. Graec. Fragm.</title> p. 755 (2nd ed.).

The <quote lang="greek">*filokth/ths</quote> mentioned by Suidas among the works of Philocles may have been that of his uncle Aeschylus, as Otto Ribbeck suggested (<title>Rom. Trag&ouml;d.</title> p. 376).</note>. Nothing of interest is known concerning these lost works,&mdash;except, indeed, one curious detail. Theodectes, whose repute stood high in the time of Aristotle, represented the sufferer as wounded in the hand, not in the foot<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="4" resp="RCJ">In  <title>Eth. N.</title> 7. 8 (p. 1150 <emph>b</emph> 9) the Philoctetes of Theodectes is cited as an instance of a man fighting against pain which at last overcomes him. A schol. there (<title>Anecd. Paris.</title> vol. I. p. 243, 15) says that this poet represented him as <quote lang="greek">th\n xei=ra dedhgme/non</quote>, and as exclaiming, <quote lang="greek">ko/yate th\n e)mh\n xei=ra</quote>. The last words are doubtless a mere paraphrase.</note>. The motive of this innovation is not  difficult to divine. Aristophanes touches on the predilection of Euripides for maimed heroes; and in the comedies which had been written on the subject of Philoctetes his disabled foot had doubtless been made a prominent trait<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">  <bibl n="Aristoph. Ach. 411.">Ar. <title>Ach.</title> 411.</bibl>The Sicilian Epicharmus had written a piece on Philoctetes; and Strattis, one of the latest poets of the Old Comedy (<emph>c.</emph> 412&mdash;384 B.C.), had taken the same theme. The ascription of a play on this subject to Antiphanes (of the Middle Comedy) is perhaps erroneous: see p. xxxi, n. 3.</note>. Theodectes wished to avoid all associations of burlesque. His expedient for dignifying the warrior's misfortune is very characteristic of the decadence.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Attius.</note> &sect; 18. In the best age of Roman Tragedy, Attius (<emph>c.</emph> 140 B.C.) composed a <title>Philocteta</title>, of which some small fragments remain,&mdash; less than fifty lines in all. Much ingenuity has been expended on conjectures as to the plot. But the evidence is too scanty to warrant any conclusion<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ">Ribbeck (<title>Scenicae Rom. poesis fragm.</title> pp. 308 ff.) thinks that Attius followed Euripides, for the most part, in his general design, but borrowed occasional touches from Aeschylus, Sophocles, and the minor Greek dramatists. The impossibility of solving the question is sensibly recognised by Schneidewin (<title>Philologus</title> IV. p. 656) and Milani (<title>Mito di F.</title>, p. 47). One point of interest may, however, be noticed. Attius made <emph>some one</emph> tell the same story which is told by the Neoptolemus of Sophocles&mdash;viz., that Odysseus still held the armour of Achilles (see fr. 16). But no one could use this fiction with so much effect as the person chiefly aggrieved. Perhaps, then, Attius followed Sophocles in associating Odysseus with Neoptolemus.</note>. Many of the verses have a rugged power,&mdash;as these, for instance, spoken by the hero in his agony:&mdash;

<p>The adventures of Philoctetes after the Trojan war were <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Euphorion.</note>related by Euphorion of Chalcis (<emph>c.</emph> 220 B.C.), in a short epic (<quote lang="greek">*filokth/ths</quote>), of which only five lines, preserved by Stobaeus, are extant, but of which the contents are partly known from a note of Tzetzes on Lycophron<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="3" resp="RCJ"> <title>Flor.</title> 59. 16.

<p>Once, at least, in modern literature the story of Philo- <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">F&eacute;nelon's <title>T&eacute;l&eacute;maque.</title></note> ctetes has been treated with a really classical grace. The mind of F&eacute;nelon was in natural sympathy with the spirit of ancient Greek poetry; and the twelfth book of the <title>T&eacute;l&eacute;maque</title>, where Philoctetes relates his fortunes to Telemachus, is marked by this distinction. F&eacute;nelon varies the earlier part of the legend, following a version which is given by Servius<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">On   <bibl n="Verg. A. 3. 402.">Verg. <title>Aen.</title> 3. 402.</bibl></note>. Heracles, when about to perish on Mount Oeta, wished that the resting-place of his ashes should remain unknown. Philoctetes swore to keep the secret. Odysseus afterwards came in search of Heracles, and at last prevailed on Philoctetes to reveal the spot,&mdash;not, indeed, by words, but by stamping upon it. It was for this that Philoctetes was punished by the gods. One of the arrows of Heracles&mdash;tinged with the venom of the Lernaean hydra&mdash;dropped from his hand, and wounded the offending foot. For almost all that part of the story which passes in Lemnos, F&eacute;nelon has closely followed the play of Sophocles. Many passages are translated or paraphrased with happy effect. He wished, however, to present the father of Telemachus in a more favourable light; and so it is Odysseus, not Neoptolemus, who restores the bow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Farewell, thou promontory where Echo so often repeated <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Lessing.</note> my cries&rsquo;&mdash;says the Philoctetes of F&eacute;nelon,&mdash;true to the text of Sophocles. The <title>T&eacute;l&eacute;maque</title> appeared in 1699. More than half a century later, these laments of Philoctetes became the starting-point of a discussion destined to have fruitful results. Winckelmann, speaking of the Laocoon, had observed that the marble indicates no loud cry, but rather &lsquo;a subdued groan of anguish&rsquo;: &lsquo;Laocoon suffers, but he suffers like the Philoctetes of Sophocles.&rsquo; Lessing, in his <title>Laocoon</title> (1766), pointed out that the Philoctetes of Sophocles shrieks aloud, and that Heracles, in the <title>Trachiniae</title>, does the same. &lsquo;The ancient Greek uttered his anguish and his sorrow; he was ashamed of no mortal weakness.&rsquo; If, then, the poet expresses the cry of bodily pain, while the  sculptor refrains from expressing it, the reason must be sought in the different conditions of the two arts. At the time when Lessing wrote, the general tendency of contemporary taste was in agreement with the view on which Cicero insists, that any outward manifestation of pain is unworthy of a great mind, and that a wrong had been done to the heroic character by those poets who had permitted their heroes to utter lamentations<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ"><title>Tusc. Disp.</title> 2. 13. 32, Afflictusne et iacens et lamentabili voce deplorans, audies, <title>O virum fortem?</title> Te vero, ita affectum, ne virum quidem dixerit quisquam. Aut mittenda igitur fortitudo est, aut sepeliendus dolor.</note>. This maxim is exemplified in the tragedies of the stoic Seneca, whose persons are forcibly described by Lessing as &lsquo;prize-fighters in buskins<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ">He ingeniously remarks that the influence of the gladiatorial shows may have been perverting, in this respect, to Roman Tragedy. But he might have excepted the best age of Roman Tragedy,&mdash;the second century B.C.,&mdash;when the Greek masters (chiefly Euripides) were the models. Thus Attius&mdash;as we have seen&mdash;did not shrink from allowing Philoctetes to utter cries of anguish.</note>&rsquo;: it had also been observed on the classical stage of France.</p>
<p>In a passage of excellent criticism,&mdash;which has lost nothing of its value because it closed the aesthetic controversy which it concerns,&mdash;Lessing shows how Sophocles, in the <title>Philoctetes</title>, has reconciled the necessary portrayal of physical suffering with the highest requirements of tragic art. He takes up three points. (1) The nature of the suffering itself. The wound is a divine punishment, and there is a supernatural element in its operation: &lsquo;a poison worse than any to be found in nature&rsquo; vexes the victim. Then this affliction is joined to other evils,&mdash;solitude, hunger, hardship. (2) The expression of the suffering. It is true that, in the scene where Philoctetes utters his cries of pain (vv. 730 ff.), he believes that he is about to be rescued from Lemnos: his anguish, there, is physical only. But these cries are wrung from him by extreme torment, despite his efforts to stifle them (vv. 742 f.). They detract nothing from the heroic firmness of his character,&mdash;displayed not only in the strength of his attachments, but also (as ancient Greeks would deem) in the fixity of his resentments. &lsquo;And then we are asked to suppose that Athenians would have scorned this rock of a man, because he reverberates to waves which cannot shake him<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="3" resp="RCJ"><bibl n="Soph. Phil. 1460">Cp. 1460</bibl> <quote lang="greek">xeimazome/nw|</quote>.</note>!&rsquo; (3) The  effect of this expression upon the other persons. As Lessing acutely remarks, the dramatic inconvenience of a hero who cries aloud from bodily pain is that such a cry, though it need not excite contempt, seems to demand <emph>more</emph> sympathy than is usually forthcoming. Sophocles has forestalled this difficulty &lsquo;by causing the other persons of the drama to have their own interests.&rsquo; That is, when Philoctetes shrieks, the mind of the spectator is not occupied in gauging the precise amount of sympathy shown by Neoptolemus, but rather in watching how it will affect his secret purpose. &lsquo;If Philoctetes had been able to hide his suffering, Neoptolemus would have been able to sustain his deceit... Philoctetes, who is all nature, brings back Neoptolemus to his own nature. This return is excellent, and the more affecting because it is the result of pure humanity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The last words allude to a French drama in which a different <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">French dramas.</note> motive had been employed. Ch&acirc;teaubrun, in his <title>Philoct&egrave;te</title> (1755), had given the hero a daughter named Sophie, who (with her <emph>gouvernante</emph>) visited Lemnos; and the romantic passion with which Sophie inspired Neoptolemus became his chief reason for assisting her father. Two other French dramas of the same title, those of Ferrand (1780) and La Harpe (1781), are noticed by M. Patin<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ"><emph>&Eacute;tudes sur les Tragiques grecs: Sophocle:</emph> pp. 92 ff.; 149 f.</note>; but a comparative respect for the example of Sophocles is the highest merit which he ascribes to either.

A supplement, entitled <title>Nuovi Monumenti di Filottete</title> (Rome, 1882), contains at the end a synoptical table, enumerating 63 works of art which relate to the subject.</note>. He is seen assisting, in his youth, at the sacrifices offered to Chrys&egrave; by Heracles and by Jason;&mdash;standing beside the pyre of Heracles on Oeta; &mdash;wounded by the serpent, at his second visit to Chrys&egrave;'s shrine;  &mdash;abandoned in Lemnos;&mdash;finally, tended by the &lsquo;healing hands&rsquo; at Troy, and victorious over Paris.</p>
<p>A peculiar interest belongs to the representations of his sufferings in Lemnos, since they exhibit three principal types, each of which can be traced to the influence of an eminent artist. (i) The sculptor Pythagoras of Rhegium (<emph>c.</emph> 460 B.C.), famous especially for his athletes, excelled in the expression of sinews and veins. One of his best-known works was a statue at Syracuse, which represented a man limping, with a sore in his foot. &lsquo;Those who look at it,&rsquo; says Pliny, &lsquo;seem to feel the pain<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ"><title>Hist. Nat.</title> 34. 59.</note>.&rsquo; There can be no doubt that the subject was Philoctetes. As an example of the later works which were probably copied, more or less directly, from this statue, may be mentioned a cornelian intaglio, now in the Museum of Berlin<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ">Milani, <title>Mito di F.</title>, p. 78.</note>. Philoctetes is walking, with the aid of a stick held in his left hand: in his right he carries the bow and quiver: his left foot,&mdash;the wounded one, as a bandage indicates,&mdash;is put forward, while the weight of the body is thrown on the right foot. The figure illustrates a principle which Pythagoras of Rhegium is said to have introduced,&mdash;viz., a correspondence between the attitude of the left leg and that of the right arm, or <emph>vice versa</emph>,&mdash;a symmetry obtained by an artificial balance of movements<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="3" resp="RCJ">Such equipoise was technically called &lsquo;chiasmus,&rsquo;&mdash;a term borrowed from the form of the Greek X, and transferred from rhetoric to sculpture.</note>. It is noteworthy that a standing or walking Philoctetes occurs only on engraved gems, and in one mural painting at Pompeii (of about 30 B.C.) which may also have been suggested by the Syracusan statue. (ii) A very beautiful Athenian vase-painting, of about 350 B.C., shows Philoctetes sitting on a rock in Lemnos, under the leafless branches of a stunted tree; his head is bowed, as if in dejection; the bandaged left foot is propped on a stone, and the left hand clasps the left knee<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="4" resp="RCJ">  <title>Ib.</title>p. 80. Milani has chosen this picture as the frontispiece of his monograph. The vase is an aryballos, now the property of   CastellaniA. , of Rome.</note>. He wears a sleeveless Doric chiton, girt round the waist; at his right side the bow and arrows rest on the ground. It is probable that the source of this vase-painting was a picture by Parrhasius, who is known to have taken  Philoctetes for his subject at a date slightly earlier than that to which the vase is referred. The distinctive feature here is the predominance of mental over physical pain;&mdash;a conception which might have been suggested to the painter by the Attic dramatists. (iii) In a third series of representations, Philoctetes reclines on the ground, fanning his wounded foot with the wing of a bird, or with a branch. This type occurs only on gems, and appears to have been originated by Boethus of Chalcedon, a gem-engraver of high repute, who lived probably in the early part of the third century B.C.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">Milani, pp. 85 ff., and <title>Nuovi Monumenti</title>, p. 275.&mdash;It has been conjectured that the <title>Philoctetes</title> of Aeschylus was the literary source used by Boethus. This is not improbable (see next note). But it is not likely that the winged creatures which the sufferer fanned away from his foot are the <quote lang="greek">o)/kornoi</quote> (&lsquo;locusts&rsquo;) or <quote lang="greek">fa/bes</quote> (&lsquo;wild pigeons&rsquo;) which were mentioned in that play (fr. 251 f., ed. Nauck).</note></p>
<p>Some other scenes found on works of art, in which Philoctetes is no longer alone, were directly inspired by Attic Tragedy. An engraved gem, now in the British Museum, represents the theft of the bow by Odysseus, as Aeschylus appears to have imagined it<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ">The gem is a sardonyx intaglio, no. 829 in the Hertz collection, and shows the recumbent Philoctetes fanning his foot to keep off some winged creatures; while Odysseus, characterised by the <quote lang="greek">pi=los</quote>, stands at his back, in the act of taking the bow from the place where it is suspended. This recalls a fragment of the Aeschylean <title>Philoctetes</title>, <quote lang="greek">krema/sasa</quote> (<quote lang="greek">kremasta\</quote>?) <quote lang="greek">to/ca pi/tuos e)k melandru/ou</quote>. See Milani, <title>Mito di F.</title>, p. 90.</note>. Euripides has been the source of some reliefs on alabaster urns of the second century B.C.; two Trojan envoys, on the left hand of Philoctetes, are inviting him to follow them, while on his right hand are Odysseus and Diomedes, in an attitude of remonstrance; or Philoctetes, in acute pain, is tended by Odysseus, while Diomedes, at the sufferer's back, seizes the bow and quiver<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="3" resp="RCJ">Milani, pp. 96 ff. Each of these subjects occurs on several urns, most of which were found at Volterra; some of them are in the museum there, others at Florence, and one at Cortona.</note>. Nor has Sophocles been neglected; Odysseus instructing Neoptolemus appears on a marble medallion<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="4" resp="RCJ">Now in the Vatican Library. Milani, p. 91.</note> of the first or second century A.D. ; and a sarcophagus<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="5" resp="RCJ">Now in the garden of the Villa Gherardesca at Florence.   <title>Ib.</title>pp. 92 ff.</note> of the same period shows the moment when Odysseus starts forward to prevent his more generous comrade from restoring the bow to its despairing master (v. 974). </p>

<div2 id="cis21" type="section" n="21">
<p>But the most valuable contribution of art to the interpretation of the play is a vase-painting of Philoctetes wounded at the shrine of Chrys&egrave;. This incident, like the personality of Chrys&egrave; herself, is left indistinct by the allusions in the poet's text; and such indistinctness,&mdash;easily tolerated by ancient audiences in matters which lay &lsquo;outside of the tragedy,&rsquo;&mdash;tends to weaken a modern reader's grasp of the story. It is therefore interesting to know how the whole scene was conceived by a Greek artist nearly contemporary with Sophocles. The painting occurs on a round wine-jar (<quote lang="greek">sta/mnos</quote>), found at Caere in southern Etruria, and now in the Campana collection of the Louvre: the date to which it is assigned is about 400 B.C.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">Milani, p. 68.</note>
<!-- this paragraph is illustrated by a vase from the Louvre;  we don't have a picture of it --></p>
<p>The place is the sacred precinct of Chrys&egrave;&mdash;&lsquo;the roofless sanctuary&rsquo; of which Sophocles speaks&mdash;in the island of the same name, near the eastern coast of Lemnos. Philoctetes, who has just been bitten in the foot by the snake, is lying on the ground, overcome by pain, and crying aloud, as the open mouth indicates. The laurel-wreath worn by him, as by all the other persons of the group, denotes that he had been sacrificing. A beardless youth who bends over the sufferer, as if about to raise him in his arms, is probably Palamedes; his  chlamys is girt about his loins in the manner used by sacrificers. On the left, the image of Chrys&egrave; is seen behind her burning altar; the snake, &lsquo;the lurking guardian&rsquo; of her shrine (v. 1327 f.),&mdash; which had crept forth as Philoctetes approached&mdash;is again seeking its hiding-place, while Agamemnon strikes at it with his sceptre. Next to him on the right is the beardless Achilles, with chlamys girt at the waist, and a piece of flesh, roasted for the sacrifice, on a spit (<quote lang="greek">o)belo/s</quote>) in his hand: then the bearded Diomedes, wrapt in his himation: and, on the extreme right, a similar form, possibly Menelaus<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">So Michaelis conjectures (<title>Annal. dell' Istit. di Corr. Archeol.</title>, 1857, p. 252). Milani, however, thinks that the artist introduced this figure merely because the symmetry of the picture required it, and had no definite person in view (p. 69).</note>. The attitudes express horror at the disaster<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ">In the original, the names <quote lang="greek">*f*i*l*o*k*t*e*t*e*s, *x*r*u*s*e, *d*i*o*m*e .. *s</quote> appear above the heads of those persons respectively: the names of Agamemnon and Achilles have been almost obliterated, but <quote lang="greek">*a......*w*n</quote> and <quote lang="greek">*a......*s</quote> remain. No trace of a name appears over the supposed Menelaus.</note>. If the followers of the Greek chiefs are imagined as gathered around this group, awe-struck spectators of the interrupted rite, nothing is wanting to a picture of the moment indicated by Sophocles, when the &lsquo;ill-omened cries&rsquo; of Philoctetes &lsquo;filled the camp,&rsquo; and at length prompted the cruel resolve to carry him across the narrow strait, and abandon him on the lonely shore of Lemnos.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cis22" type="section" n="22">
<p>A further point of interest in this vase-painting is its <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Chrys&egrave;.</note> representation of the mysterious Chrys&egrave;. Her image has the rigid character of a primitive temple-image (<quote lang="greek">co/anon</quote>). The high <quote lang="greek">ka/laqos</quote> or <quote lang="greek">po/los</quote> on her head seems to indicate a Chthonian power, as in the case of Demeter, Artemis Tauropolos, and Artemis Orthia. A very similar representation of her occurs on another vase&mdash;a &lsquo;vinegar-cup&rsquo; (oxybaphon) of the fifth or fourth century B.C., now in the Lamberg collection at Vienna<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="3" resp="RCJ">Milani, pp. 60 ff.</note>. The scene there depicted is the first sacrifice of Philoctetes at Chrys&egrave;'s altar, in company with Heracles; and there, as here, her identity is made certain by her name being written above. There, too, her hands are uplifted; but she wears a corona, not the calathus; and a broad stripe, which runs down her robe from neck to feet,  is studded with two rows of discs, which appear to symbolise stars. Here, also, such discs are seen, though only on the girdle and on the lower edge of the garment. According to one theory, Chrys&egrave; was merely a form of Athena,&mdash;the epithet &lsquo;golden&rsquo; having been substituted for the personal name,&mdash;and the serpent at her shrine is to be compared with the guardian of the Erechtheum (<ref target="cl1327" targOrder="U">see on 1327</ref> ff.). But there is more probability in the view of Petersen<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">Ersch and Gruber's <title>Encyc.</title>, art. <title>Griechische Mythologie</title>, p. 294.</note>, that Chrys&egrave; is a Greek form of Bendis. The Thracian Bendis was a lunar deity, sharing some attributes of Artemis (with whom the Greeks chiefly associated her), Hecate, Selene, and Persephone. The worship of Bendis seems to have existed in Lemnos, as at Athens. On the other hand, Chrys&egrave; is always connected with places near the Thracian coasts. Lenormant, adopting this view, remarked that, if the name Bendis meant &lsquo;bright<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ">As Jacob Grimm conjectured, comparing <title>Vanadis</title>, a surname of Freyja.</note>,&rsquo; then <quote lang="greek">*xru/sh</quote> (=<quote lang="greek">xrush=</quote>) may have been a direct translation of it<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="3" resp="RCJ">Daremberg and Saglio, <title>Dict. des Antiquit&eacute;s</title>, I. p. 686.</note>. Thus, when Heracles, Jason and Agamemnon&mdash;all bound on perilous enterprises&mdash;offered sacrifice at Chrys&egrave;'s altar, they might be regarded as seeking to conciliate an alien deity. Sophocles imagines her as a cruel being (<quote lang="greek">w)mo/frwn</quote>) whom higher powers&mdash;for their own good purpose&mdash;have permitted to wreak her anger; but he does not further define her supernatural rank.</p>

<p>The <title>Philoctetes</title> was produced at the Great Dionysia, late in March, 409 B.C., and gained the first prize<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="4" resp="RCJ">See the second Argument to the play, p. 4.</note>. Sophocles, according to the tradition, would then have been eighty-seven. Able critics have favoured the view that his choice of this subject was in some way connected with the return of Alcibiades<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="5" resp="RCJ"> Sch Ad.&ouml;ll, <title>Sophokles.

Patin (<title>Sophocle</title>, p. 125) mentions, as the earliest expression of such a view, an art. by M. Lebeau jeune in the <title>M&eacute;m. de l' Acad. des Inscriptions</title>, vol. XXXV.</note>. It was in 411 B.C. that Thrasybulus had prevailed on the democratic leaders at Samos to send for Alcibiades, and to  elect him one of the ten generals<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ"><bibl n="Thuc. 8.81">Thuc. 8. 81, 82</bibl>. The first overtures of Alcibiades had been made to the oligarchs in the army at Samos (<bibl n="Thuc. .8.47">ib. 47</bibl>), and had led to the Revolution of the Four Hundred.</note>,&mdash;a measure by which, as Grote says, &lsquo;he was relieved substantially, though not in strict form,&rsquo; from the penalties of banishment. In 410 Alcibiades had been the principal author of the Athenian victory at Cyzicus. Thus, at the date of the <title>Philoctetes</title>, men's minds had already been prepared for his formal restitution to citizenship&mdash;which took place on his return to Athens in 407 B.C. It is easy to draw a parallel between the baffled army at Troy, with their fate hanging on an estranged comrade, and the plight of Athens, whose hopes were centred on an exile. Nay, even the passage where Philoctetes learns who have perished, and who survive, in the Greek army has been read as a series of allusions to dead or living Athenians. Then Neoptolemus is Thrasybulus: and the closing words of Heracles (<quote lang="greek">eu)sebei=n ta\ pro\s qeou/s</quote>) convey a lesson to the suspected profaner of the Mysteries. Now, to suppose that Sophocles intended a political allegory of this kind, is surely to wrong him grievously as a poet. At the same time it must be recognised that the coincidence of date is really remarkable. It is not impossible that his thoughts may have been first turned to this theme by the analogy which he perceived in it to events of such deep interest for his countrymen<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ">There is one passage in the <title>Philoctetes</title>, which, though it should not be regarded as a direct allusion to recent events, might certainly suggest that they were present to the poet's mind: see commentary on vv. 385 ff.</note>. But the play itself is the best proof that, having chosen his subject, he treated it for itself alone.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cis24" type="section" n="24">
<p>The diction of the <title>Philoctetes</title> has been regarded by <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Diction.</note> Schneidewin and others as somewhat deficient in the lofty force of earlier compositions. But this criticism is not warranted by those passages which gave the fittest scope for such a quality,&mdash; as the invocation of the Great Mother (391&mdash;402),&mdash;the noble stasimon (676&mdash;729),&mdash;and the denunciations by Philoctetes of the fraud practised against him (927&mdash;962: 1004&mdash;1044). If, in the larger part of the play, the language is of a less elevated strain, this results from the nature of the subject; since the  gradual unfolding of character, to which the plot owes its peculiar interest, is effected by the conversations of Neoptolemus with Odysseus or with Philoctetes, in which a more familiar tone necessarily predominates.</p>

<div2 id="cis25" type="section" n="25">
<p>The versification, however, clearly shows, in one respect, the general stamp of the later period. If the <title>Philoctetes</title> is compared (for example) with the <title>Antigone</title>, it will be apparent that the structure of the iambic trimeter has become more Euripidean. The use of tribrachs is very large. Two such feet occur consecutively in the same verse (<cit><bibl n="Soph.

Eum. 780"><title>Eum.</title> 780</bibl>). An anapaest in the first place of the verse occurs not less than thirteen times (<bibl n="Soph. Phil. 308">308</bibl>, <bibl n="Soph.

<p> Prologue. Odysseus tells Neoptolemus that this is the spot where, ten years before, he had put Philoctetes ashore. Neoptolemus presently finds the cave, with traces in it which show that it is still inhabited. Odysseus then suggests that he should capture Philoctetes and his bow by a stratagem. He is to pretend that he has quarrelled with the Atreidae, and is sailing homeward. The youth at first refuses; but ultimately yields to the argument that only thus can he win the glory of taking Troy.&mdash;Odysseus returns to his ship, leaving Neoptolemus to watch for Philoctetes at the cave.

Sophocles wished to avoid that defect. Everything that is said of Lemnos throughout this play would naturally suggest a wholly uninhabited island. And the words ascribed to Philoctetes (vv. 220 f., 300 ff.) require us to suppose that he, at least, believed it to be so. The <title>Iliad</title>, however, represents <quote lang="greek">*eu)/nhos</quote>, son of Jason and Hypsipyl&egrave;, as reigning in Lemnos during the Trojan war (7. 467); and it was into &lsquo;well-peopled Lemnos&rsquo; that Achilles sold Lycaon (21. 40). It is simplest to suppose that Sophocles, finding it convenient to have a desert island, ignored the Homeric notices. But it is also possible that he conceived the island as inhabited in some parts and desolate in others. This is the scholiast's view: <quote lang="greek">e)n e)rh/mw| ga\r me/rei th=s *lh/mnou e)cete/qh</quote>. The area of Lemnos is about 150 square miles, or more than thrice that of Jersey.

It might be suggested that the <quote lang="greek">ou)de/m)</quote> of the 1st hand in L came, not from <quote lang="greek">ou)de/n m)</quote>, but from <quote lang="greek">ou)de/n)</quote>, and that the sense is, &lsquo;thou wilt pain no one of <emph>them</emph>&rsquo; (masc.),&mdash;so that <quote lang="greek">kaq' h(mw=n</quote> in 65 should mean, Odysseus and the Atreidae. But this cannot be; for, here, there has been no direct mention of the Atreidae,&mdash;only of <quote lang="greek">*)axaiw=n</quote> generally (59); and so, for contrast with <quote lang="greek">pa=sin *)argei/ois</quote> (67), the pain denoted by <quote lang="greek">a)lgunei=s</quote> must be pain to Odysseus. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">tou/twn ga\r ou)de/n' a)lgunei=s</lemma> being thus set aside, we have to weigh (1) <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">tou/twn ga\r ou)de\n a)lgunei= m)</lemma>,&mdash; Dindorf's conjecture; and (2) <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">tou/tw| ga\r ou)de/n m' a)lgunei=s</lemma>,&mdash;Buttmann's. Both being possible, the question is, which of them is most likely to have generated <quote lang="greek">tou/twn ga\r ou)de/n m' a)lgunei=s</quote>. The fact that <quote lang="greek">a)lgunei=s</quote> precedes <quote lang="greek">e)rga/sei</quote> diminishes the probability that <quote lang="greek">a)lgunei=s</quote> arose from <quote lang="greek">a)lgunei= m)</quote> by assimilation of persons. Further, had <quote lang="greek">ou)de/n m' a)lgunei=s</quote> come from <quote lang="greek">ou)de\n a)lgunei= m)</quote>, we might have expected to find a variant, <quote lang="greek">ou)de\n a)lgunei=s m)</quote>. If, on the other hand, the words <quote lang="greek">ou)de/n m' a)lgunei=s</quote> are genuine, we have only to suppose a change of <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">tou/twi</lemma> into <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">tou/twn</lemma>. On these palaeographical grounds Buttmann's reading appears preferable to Dindorf's.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">poh/sw</lemma>. Numerous Attic inscriptions of the 5th and 4th centuries B.C. show that in this verb the letter <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">i</lemma> was regularly omitted before a following E-sound (<quote lang="greek">e</quote> or <quote lang="greek">h</quote>), though never before an O-sound (<quote lang="greek">o</quote> or <quote lang="greek">w</quote>): hence (<foreign lang="la">e.g.</foreign>) <quote lang="greek">poei=, poh/sas</quote>, but <quote lang="greek">poiou=si, poiw=n</quote>. It should be noted that <quote lang="greek">po-</quote> and <quote lang="greek">poi-</quote>, according as the E- or O-sound follows, sometimes occur in the same inscription: thus in <title>C. I. A.</title> 167, 55 (of 334&mdash;326 B.C.) we find <quote lang="greek">poiw=n</quote> (thrice) in company with <quote lang="greek">poh/sas</quote>. The omission of <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">i</lemma> before the E-sound was not, indeed, rigorous; thus an Attic inscription of the 5th cent. B.C. gives <quote lang="greek">*eu)/frwn e)cepoi/hs' ou)k a)dah\s *pa/rios</quote>: but the facts prove that it was usual. See Meisterhans, <title>Gramm. d. Att. Inschriften</title>, p. 27. As to L, its practice is not constant. It almost always gives <quote lang="greek">po</quote>, not <quote lang="greek">poi</quote>, before <quote lang="greek">e</quote> or <quote lang="greek">h</quote>, when the first syllable is short,&mdash;as here, and in vv. 552, 752, 926, 1010. In a few such places where the first hand had written <quote lang="greek">poi</quote> it has been corrected to <quote lang="greek">po</quote>. But there are also a few places where <quote lang="greek">poi</quote> remains. See Appendix. In writing <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">poh/sw</lemma>, etc., I. rely primarily on the epigraphic evidence belonging to the poet's own time: but L's prevailing practice must also be considered as strengthening the grounds for believing that those inscriptions represent the general rule.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">pa=san ai)sxu/nhn a)fei/s</lemma>. This verse does not (as some have objected) mark an abrupt change of mind; that change has come by a series of steps which the poet has indicated by light touches (91 ff., 110, 116, 118). Rather this very phrase hints that the feeling shown in v. 110 still lingers with him. He will do the deed, but there is still a sense of <quote lang="greek">ai)sxu/nh</quote> which it costs an effort to shake off. These are the words of one who may yet feel remorse.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*ni/kh t' *)aqa/na *polia/s</lemma>. The personified <quote lang="greek">*ni/kh</quote> meant Victory not merely in war but in any contest. She was especially associated with Zeus; but his daughter was the only goddess with whom she was actually identified. Thus  Eur. ( <bibl n="Eur. Ion 452">Eur. <title>Ion</title> 452</bibl> ff.): <quote lang="greek">ta\n...e)ma\n</quote> &verbar; <quote lang="greek">*)aqa/nan i(keteu/w</quote>, &verbar; ...<quote lang="greek">w)= ma/kaira *ni/ka</quote>, &verbar; <quote lang="greek">mo/le</quote>. And Aristeides, in his oration on Athena, says of her, <quote lang="greek">mo/nh me\n a(pa/ntwn qew=n, o(moi/ws de\ pasw=n, ou)k e)pw/numos th=s vi/khs e)sti/n</quote> [in such epithets as <quote lang="greek">nikhfo/ros</quote>], <quote lang="greek">a)ll' o(mw/numos</quote> (I. p. 29). At Athens the small Ionic temple of <quote lang="greek">*)aqhna= *ni/kh</quote> stood on the platform of a bastion (<quote lang="greek">pu/rgos</quote>) springing from the south wing of the Propylaea, on the right hand of one ascending to the Acropolis. The figure of the goddess, probably a work of Calamis, bore a helmet in her left hand, and in her right a pomegranate (<quote lang="greek">si/dh</quote>), her regular attribute in the Athena-cult at Sid&egrave; in Pamphylia. As Benndorf has shown (<title>Ueber das Kultusbild der Athena Nike</title>, Vienna, 1879), the temple probably commemorated Cimon's victory over the Persians at the mouth of the Eurymedon, near Sid&egrave; (466 B.C.). This <quote lang="greek">*)aqhna= *ni_/kh</quote> was the figure which at Athens came to be popularly known as the Wingless Victory, <quote lang="greek">*ni/kh *)/apteros</quote>. Wings were the distinctive attribute of <quote lang="greek">*ni/kh</quote> in art: and Athenians were familiar with the winged <quote lang="greek">*ni/kh</quote> which the chryselephantine Athena of Pheidias, in the Parthenon, held in her outstretched right hand (cp.   <bibl n="Aristoph. Birds 574">Ar. <title>Av.</title> 574</bibl>).  The conception of <quote lang="greek">*)aqhna= *ni/kh</quote> was not exclusively Athenian. Thus Pausanias saw at Megara <quote lang="greek">i(ero\n *)aqhna=s...kaloume/nhs *ni/khs</quote> (1. 42. 4).</p>
<p>The same remark applies to the name <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*polia/s</lemma>. At Athens it denoted Athena as guardian of citadel, city, and land. Athena Polias was represented by the old <quote lang="greek">bre/tas</quote> of olive-wood in the Erechtheum. But she bore the title <quote lang="greek">*polia/s</quote> in many other places also, especially in the Ionic cities of Asia Minor,&mdash;as at Erythrae, Prien&egrave;, Teos, Phocaea (<bibl n="Paus. 7.5.3">Paus. 7. 5. 3, 4</bibl>: <bibl n="Paus. 2.31.9">2. 31. 9</bibl>). Equivalent titles were <quote lang="greek">*polia=tis, *poliou=xos</quote>, and (in a case noticed by Leake, <title>Morea</title>, II. p. 80) <quote lang="greek">*(aghsi/polis</quote>. Cp. Aristeides I. p. 21: <quote lang="greek">kai\ ei)si\n ai( po/leis dw=ra *)aqhna=s: o(/qen dh\ kai\ *poliou=xos a)/pasi ke/klhtai</quote>.

<p> Parodos. For the metres see Metrical Analysis. The framework is as follows. (1) 1st strophe 135&mdash;143 =1st antistrophe 150&mdash;158. (2) 2nd str. 169&mdash;179=2nd antistr. 180&mdash;190. (3) 3rd str. 201&mdash;209=3rd antistr. 210&mdash; 218. An anapaestic system (<quote lang="greek">su/sthma</quote>) of six verses (144&mdash;149) follows the 1st strophe: another, of ten verses (159&mdash; 168) follows the 1st antistrophe; and a third, also of ten (191&mdash;200), follows the 2nd antistrophe. With respect to the manner in which the anapaests are interspersed with the lyrics, we may compare the Parodos of the   <title>O. C.</title>(where see n. on 117),&mdash;the play which is probably nearest in date to the <title>Philoctetes</title>, both being among the poet's latest works. On the other hand, in the Parodos of the <title>Antigone</title> (an early play), there is a stricter symmetry between the anapaestic systems (see n. there on 100).</p>
<p>The Chorus consists of 15 men belonging to the ship of Neoptolemus, who is their prince and their &lsquo;captain&rsquo; (<quote lang="greek">naukra/twr</quote>, 1072). As he is so youthful (<quote lang="greek">pai=s</quote>, <emph>ib.</emph>), they can address him as <quote lang="greek">te/knon</quote> (141), <quote lang="greek">pai=</quote> (201). It does not follow that they were actually <quote lang="greek">ge/rontes</quote>, as the author of the prose Argument (p. 4) calls them.</p>
<p>This ode is well fitted for its place at the opening of the play. In the prologue Neoptolemus has been the pupil of a crafty veteran; now he is the young leader to whom the sailors look for guidance. Hitherto the foremost topic has been the importance of capturing Philoctetes; here our thoughts are turned to his sufferings. And so, when the ode closes, the mind has been prepared for the coming conflict of motives.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*o)rei/a d'</lemma>,  MeklerS. 's correction of <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">barei=a d)</lemma>, occurs in his revision of <bibl>Dindorf (6th Teubner ed., 1885)</bibl>, where it is placed in the text. But, so far as I know, the arguments for it have not yet been stated. It is one of those emendations, the probability of which cannot be adequately estimated at a first glance, but must be carefully considered in relation to the peculiarities of the MS. (1) We observe, then, that L has <quote lang="greek">barei=</quote>&verbar;<quote lang="greek">ad' a)quro/stomos</quote>. This favours the view that v. 188 began with <quote lang="greek">a d)</quote> rather than <quote lang="greek">a( d)</quote>. But, as metre proves, that <quote lang="greek">a</quote> must  have been <quote lang="greek">a_</quote>, not <quote lang="greek">a^</quote>: and this points to an ending <quote lang="greek">-ei/</quote>&verbar;<quote lang="greek">a_</quote>, as in <quote lang="greek">o)rei/</quote>&verbar;<quote lang="greek">a</quote>. (2) Some corruptions in L, as in other MSS., have arisen through the genuine word being mistaken for one resembling it in form; as <quote lang="greek">a)/xos</quote> has become <quote lang="greek">a)/xqos</quote> in  <bibl n="Soph. OT 1355."> <title>O. T.</title> 1355.</bibl>And this could occur even when the initial of the false word did not belong to the true word. See  <bibl n="Soph.

For <quote lang="greek">toma=|</quote>, L there has <quote lang="greek"><emph>st</emph>omai=</quote>: and this, not merely through the influence of <quote lang="greek">stono/entos</quote>, but, evidently, because the scribe was thinking of <quote lang="greek">sto/ma</quote>. Thus, even without assuming an intermediate <quote lang="greek">a)rei/</quote>&verbar;<quote lang="greek">a</quote> or <quote lang="greek">a)rei=</quote>&verbar;<quote lang="greek">a</quote>, we see that <quote lang="greek">barei=</quote>&verbar;<quote lang="greek">a</quote> was a possible corruption of <quote lang="greek">o)rei/</quote>&verbar;<quote lang="greek">a</quote>. Note, as increasing the probability, that v. 208, <quote lang="greek">barei=a thlo/qen au)da/</quote>, stands in L in the middle of the same page (82 A) which contains this verse. (3) <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">o)rei/a</lemma>, as an epithet for Echo here, is illustrated by the only other place in the play where such echo is spoken of: 1458 <quote lang="greek">polla\ de\ fwnh=s th=s h(mete/ras</quote> &verbar; <quote lang="greek">*(ermai=on o)/ros pare/pemyen e)moi/</quote>.

Next, suppose that <quote lang="greek">nauti/lw| pla/th|</quote> was the true reading. It is clear and neat. To account for the variant <quote lang="greek">ka)k poi/as pa/tras</quote>, we must then suppose either (<emph>a</emph>) that a scribe wrote those words by an oversight,&mdash;his eye having wandered to v. 222; which is the less likely, since v. 222 did not give him <quote lang="greek">ka)k</quote>: or (<emph>b</emph>) that, <quote lang="greek">nauti/lw| pla/th|</quote> having been somehow lost, he filled the gap with a clumsy loan from v. 222.

Another point, though not a strong one, in favour of <quote lang="greek">ka)k poi/as pa/tras</quote> is that the two questions (&lsquo;who, and whence?&rsquo;) are habitually combined in such inquiries: <foreign lang="la">e.g.</foreign>,   <bibl n="Soph. El. 779">Soph. <title>El.</title> 779</bibl><quote lang="greek">xai/ret), w)= ce/noi: ti/nes</quote> &verbar; <quote lang="greek">po/qen poreu/esq), e)ste/ t' e)k poi/as xqono/s</quote>;  <bibl n="Hdt. 1. 35">Her.  1. 35</bibl><quote lang="greek">ti/s te e)w\n kai\ ko/qen...h(/kwn</quote>: id. 2. 115 <quote lang="greek">ti/s ei)/h kai\ o(ko/qen ple/oi</quote>: 4. 145 <quote lang="greek">ti/nes te kai\ o(ko/qen ei)si/</quote>. On the other hand, we cannot insist on L's authority as against A's; for L has sometimes lost a true reading which A has kept (as in  <bibl n="Soph. Aj. 28">Soph. <title>Ai.</title> 28</bibl>).</p>
<p>But <quote lang="greek">ka)k poi/as pa/tras</quote> in v. 220 and <quote lang="greek">poi/as pa/tras</quote> in 222 cannot both be wholly sound. The first <quote lang="greek">pa/tras</quote> might easily be corrected to <quote lang="greek">xqono\s</quote> (with Wecklein). It is slightly more probable, how ever, that the second <quote lang="greek">pa/tras</quote> arose from the eye glancing back. Thus in  <bibl n="Soph. Ant. 831"> <title>Ant.</title> 831</bibl>L has <quote lang="greek">ta/kei</quote> (for <quote lang="greek">te/ggei</quote>), due to <quote lang="greek">takome/nan</quote> in 828. In v. 222 we might conjecture <quote lang="greek">poi/as <emph>po/lews</emph></quote>. (For <quote lang="greek">po/lews</quote> in the 2nd place of the senarius, cp.  <bibl n="Soph. OT 630."> <title>O.

The relative clause with the optative is, in such instances, virtually a final clause (as here, &lsquo;no one <emph>to</emph> help&rsquo;). Instead of such an optative, we usually find in Attic the fut. ind., even after a secondary tense; as if here we had <quote lang="greek">ou)x o(/stis a)rke/sei</quote>: <foreign lang="la">e.g.</foreign>  <title>H.</title> 2. 3. 2 <quote lang="greek">e)/doce tw=| dh/mw| tria/konta a)/ndras e(le/sqai, oi(\ tou\s patri/ous no/mous suggra/yousi</quote>.</p>
<p>The <emph>origin</emph> of this use of the optative is disputed. (1) According to one view, it is an extension of the <emph>deliberative</emph> use.

In <quote lang="greek">ou)de/na ei)=xon o(/stis a)rke/seien</quote> the interrogative sense of <quote lang="greek">o(/stis</quote> has passed into a purely relative sense, and the clause has become final. For this view, see  Sidgwick A. in <title>Classical Review</title>, vol. v. p. 148, 1891.

Thus, after calling their speech <quote lang="greek">tlhmone/statos</quote> (363), he remarks incidentally that Odysseus was a goodtempered man (377); and though he calls him, indeed, <quote lang="greek">ka/kistos</quote> (384), he hastens to add that the higher powers were more to blame (385).

<p> Mindful of their young chief's precept&mdash;<quote lang="greek">peirw= to\ paro\n qerapeu/ein</quote> (149)&mdash;the Chorus seize this moment in order to deepen the impression left on the mind of Philoctetes. It was in the land of the Trojans&mdash;often called &lsquo;Phrygians&rsquo; &mdash;that Neoptolemus was wronged by the Atreidae. &lsquo;Then and there&rsquo;&mdash;say the Chorus&mdash;&lsquo;we invoked the most awful deity of the land, the great Earth Mother, the Phrygian Cybele&mdash;to punish our prince's wrong.&rsquo; The interposition of the Chorus is admirably effective for the purpose of making their master's indignation appear genuine.</p>
<p>This strophe, to which vv. 507&mdash;518 form the antistrophe, is a <quote lang="greek">u(po/rxhma</quote>, or &lsquo;dance-song&rsquo; ( <bibl n="Soph. OT 1086"> <title>O.

The dochmiacs of which it is mainly composed (see Metrical Analysis) are accompanied by animated movement, expressive of the lively resentment which these memories suggest.</p>
<p>From a mythological point of view the verses are of singular interest. The attributes given to the goddess belong to three groups. (1) <quote lang="greek">pambw=ti *ga=</quote> recognises her in the primary character of an Elemental power. (2) <quote lang="greek">ma=ter...*dio/s</quote> identifies her with Rhea. (3) <quote lang="greek">o)reste/ra, leo/ntwn e)/fedre</quote>, and the mention of the Pactolus, present her as the specially Phrygian Cybele. But these three characters are completely fused in the unity of the <quote lang="greek">ma/thr po/tnia</quote>.

The name Rhea (probably connected with <quote lang="greek">e)/ra</quote>, earth) was doubtless older than Cybele (see Welcker <title>G&ouml;tterl.</title> I. 221), and in Crete the ancient cult of Rhea seems never to have passed into that of Cybele, while in Asia Minor Rhea and Cybele came to be identified. Hence Demetrius of Scepsis (in the Troad) could say that Rhea was not worshipped in Crete, because, by Rhea, he understood Cybele (Strabo p. 472). The legends of the Cretan Ida were easily transferred to the Mysian: there was a <quote lang="greek">*di/kth</quote> in the Troad (Strabo <emph>l.c.</emph>) as well as in Crete. Cp.

He died, then, either just before, or just after, the arrival of Neoptolemus at Troy. Neoptolemus implies that he left Troy for home just after the award (382). Since his indignation is feigned, it might be supposed that the interval between the award and his sailing (for Lemnos) had really been longer. But, even if that interval had been as brief as he represents it, he might still have known, before leaving Troy, that Ajax was dead.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*)anti/loxos</lemma>. Pindar is our earliest authority for the story of Antilochus saving his father Nestor's life: he brings it in <emph>&agrave; propos</emph> of a son who had driven his father's chariot in the Pythian games, and won the race (<title>Pyth.</title> 6. 38 ff.). Memnon was pressing Nestor hard, and one of the horses in Nestor's chariot had been wounded by Paris. Nestor called for help to Antilochus, who diverted Memnon's attack from his father to himself, and was killed; thus winning the fame, <quote lang="greek">u(/patos a)mfi\ tokeu=sin e)/mmen pro\s a)reta/n</quote>. The <title>Odyssey</title> notices that Antilochus was slain by Memnon, but does not say that he fell in saving his father (4. 188). At the end of the <title>Iliad</title> Antilochus is still living (23. 785 ff.); in  <bibl n="Hom. Il. 8.90"> <title>Il.</title> 8. 90</bibl> it is Diomedes who rescues Nestor (from Hector). Pindar's source was the <title>Aethiopis</title> of Arct&icirc;nus, in which Achilles avenged Antilochus by slaying Memnon.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">o(\s parh=n go/nos</lemma>, the son who was at his side:&mdash;not (I think) with direct reference to the saving of Nestor's life by Antilochus,&mdash;this is more than <quote lang="greek">parh=n</quote> could suggest, without further explanation (<bibl n="Soph.

The <title>Iliad</title> describes Nestor as having two sons at Troy, Thrasymedes and Antilochus (17. 378); and according to the <title>Odyssey</title> (3. 413 ff.) six sons were left to Nestor after the death of Antilochus, one of these being Thrasymedes. If it be suggested that the <title>Aethiopis</title> may have represented Antilochus as the last surviving son, we may reply that this is extremely improbable, when it is remembered that several Ionian colonies claimed to have been founded by the Neleidae, descendants of Nestor who emigrated from Pylus (<title>Introd. to Homer</title>, p. 167). The same consideration condemns Seyffert's <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">o(/s g' e)/t' h)=n</lemma>.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*pepa/rhqon</lemma> (now called <quote lang="greek">*sko/pelos</quote>), a small island near the Thessalian coast, about 12 miles  E. of the south end of Magnesia. The island of Sciathus lies between it and the mainland; Euboea is only 20 miles distant to the S.W., and Scyros about 40 to the S. The E. name is well-chosen, then, to make Philoctetes feel that he is listening to a neighbour of his old home. Peparethus, though not more than some 12 miles in length, with a greatest width of 5 or 6, contained three towns. Its famous wine is ranked by Aristophanes with those of Pramnus, Chios and Thasos (fr. 301). The author of [Dem. ] or. 35 &sect; 35 names Peparethus, along with Cos, Thasos and Mend&egrave;, as a seat of the wine-trade with the Euxine. An Alexandrian physician, Apollodorus, recommended the wine of Peparethus before all others, adding that its repute would be still higher, did it not require six years to attain perfection ( <title>H. N.</title> 14. 9).

The story of his capture by Odysseus does not belong to the <title>Iliad</title>, but was probably included in the <quote lang="greek">*)ilia\s *mikra/</quote> of Lesches (<emph>c.</emph> 700 B.C.),&mdash;the epic which contained the return of Philoctetes to Troy (see Introd.). Ovid associates this exploit with two other similar feats of Odysseus,&mdash;the capture of the horses of Rhesus, when their master, and the Trojan spy Dolon, were slain ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 10"> <title>Il.</title> 10</bibl>),&mdash;and the theft of the Palladium:  <bibl n="Ov.

<p>The statement of the <quote lang="greek">e)/mporos</quote> is only part of the truth. Helenus had indeed  been captured, and had said that Troy could not be taken without Philoctetes. But he had also said that Troy was destined to be taken that summer,&mdash;as if he knew that fate had decreed the return of Philoctetes,&mdash;who was then to be healed by the Asclepiadae, and to share with Neoptolemus the glory of the victory (1329&mdash;1342). Odysseus, however, believed that Philoctetes would not listen to persuasion, but must be brought back by a stratagem (103). And so the object of the <quote lang="greek">e)/mporos</quote> in referring to Helenus is merely to convince Philoctetes that Odysseus is coming, in order that the sufferer may become still more anxious to depart with Neoptolemus for Greece, as he supposes.

<p>We have already had two short choral songs,&mdash;strophe and antistrophe,&mdash;in which the Chorus sought to aid Neoptolemus by confirming the story of his quarrel with the Atreidae (391&mdash;402), and by affecting to believe that Greece is indeed the goal of his voyage (507&mdash; 518). We need not suppose that the pity which they expressed in vv. 507 ff. was wholly feigned; still, that particular expression of it belonged to the part which they were acting.</p>
<p>It is otherwise now. The Chorus are alone. Down to the end of the 2nd strophe (717) they are simply uttering what they feel. Then at v. 718 Philoctetes and Neoptolemus reappear from the cave; and in the 2nd antistrophe the Chorus once more seek to help their master's design.

(see cr. n.), these verses are longer than the corresponding vv. of the antistrophe, 693 f., <quote lang="greek">par' w(=|sto/non...ai(mathro/n</quote>. If both <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*)ici/ona</lemma> and <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">de/smion</lemma> are to be kept here, the antistrophic verses must be expanded. But those verses appear to be sound as they stand. The question is, then, whether <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*)ici/ona</lemma> or <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">de/smion</lemma> should be omitted here. I prefer to omit <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*)ici/ona</lemma>, for two reasons.</p>
<p>(1) The poet's tendency to omit the proper name in mythical allusion, when the context made his meaning clear, might be illustrated from <title>Ant,</title> 133, where Capaneus is described, yet not named; and from 966&mdash;987 of the same play, where Cleopatra&mdash;whose fate is being compared with Antigone's&mdash;is only indicated as the mother of the Phineidae (980) and the daughter of Boreas (985).</p>
<p>(2) <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">de/smion</lemma> is not, indeed, necessary to the sense. As in prose we have <quote lang="greek">a)nabiba/zein e)pi\ to\n troxo/n</quote> ( Andoc. or. 1 &sect; 43), so, here, the sense would be adequately given by <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kat' a)/mpuka &hellip; e)/balen</lemma>.

Then, omitting <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">de/smion</lemma>, we might keep the order of the MS. words, merely changing <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kat)</lemma> to <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)n)</lemma>:</p>

But, on the other hand, poetical considerations seem in favour of <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">de/smion</lemma>. It adds force to the picture of a terrible doom imposed by an irresistible power. &mdash;Other views are discussed in the Appendix. </p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)/mpuka</lemma>, here, the rim of the wheel; elsewhere always &lsquo;head-band.&rsquo; But its etymology (<quote lang="greek">a)mpi/</quote>=<quote lang="greek">a)mfi/</quote>) might easily suggest this poet. use, esp. as <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">droma/da</lemma> (perh. suggested by <quote lang="greek">troxo/s</quote>) helps it out.

<p>The MS. text here is <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">w)/lluq' w(=d' a)naci/ws: to/de qau=m' e)/xei me</lemma>.

<div3 id="cl727" type="commLine" n="727">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">o( xa/lkaspis a)nh\r</lemma>, Heracles. The epithet has an archaeological interest. In the Homeric poems, when reference is made to the exploits of Heracles, his weapon is the bow ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 5.395"> <title>Il.</title> 5. 395</bibl>:  <bibl n="Hom. Od. 8.224"> <title>Od.</title> 8. 224</bibl>, <bibl n="Hom. Od. 11.607"> Od. 11. 607</bibl>). Some ancient writers, however, expressly say that the equipment of Heracles with bow, club, and lion's skin was a comparatively late invention of the poets, and that in the oldest works of art he was represented with the armour of the ordinary Homeric warrior. According to Strabo (15. 688), the innovation could be traced back to the epic <quote lang="greek">*(hra/kleia</quote>, ascribed to Peisander (<emph>circ.</emph> 650 B.C.): <quote lang="greek">kai\ h( tou= *(hrakle/ous de\ stolh\ toiau/th polu\ newte/ra th=s *trwikh=s mnh/mhs e)sti/, pla/sma tw=n th\n *)hra/kleian poihsa/ntwn, ei)/te *pei/sandros h)=n, ei)/t' a)/llos tis: ta\ d' a)rxai=a zo/ana ou)x ou(/tw dieskeu/astai</quote> (implying that he had seen old images or statues in which Heracles had armour). Athenaeus (12. 512 F) quotes Megacleides (who wrote <quote lang="greek">peri\ *(omh/rou</quote>, prob. in the 4th cent. B.C.), as referring the invention to Stesichorus (<emph>c.</emph> 620 B.C.), and adding that Xanthus, an earlier lyric poet, had clad Heracles in the Homeric armour:&mdash;<quote lang="greek">tau=ta pla/sai prw=ton *sthsi/xoron to\n *(imerai=on. kai\ *ca/nqos d' o( melopoio/s, presbu/teros w)\n *sthsixo/rou,...ou) tau/thn au)tw=| periti/qhsi th\n stolh/n, a)lla\ th\n *(omhrikh/n</quote>. Strabo and Megacleides, then, agree thus far,&mdash; that the invention was <emph>not older than</emph> the 7th cent. B.C.</p>
<p>In this play Heracles figures especially as the former possessor of the invincible bow. Why, then, has  Soph. here chosen an epithet, <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">xa/lkaspis</lemma>, which suggests the hoplite type of Heracles? The answer seems to turn on two points. (1) A compromise between the hoplite and the archer type of Heracles can sometimes be traced in ancient art. Thus a statue belonging to the east pediment of the Aeginetan temple gives Heracles a helmet (or bonnet) of lion's skin, a bow, and a <quote lang="greek">qw/rac</quote> (Baumeister, <title>Denkm.</title> p. 335: cp. <emph>ib.</emph> p. 652 <emph>a</emph>). Sophocles himself makes a similar compromise when in  <bibl n="Soph. Trach. 510"> <title>Tr.</title> 510</bibl> ff. he arms Heracles with bow, club, and two spears. (2) The Heracles of this play is associated with the legends of Oeta and Trachis. In them, as in those of Boeotia, Heracles was preeminently the warrior, who sacked Oechalia &lsquo;with the spear&rsquo; ( <bibl n="Soph. Trach. 478"> <title>Tr.</title> 478</bibl>), and for whom Hephaestus had wrought the <quote lang="greek">a)spi/s</quote> described in the Hesiodic poem.

At this moment, above all others, there is a poetical fitness in some allusion to the hero's divine parentage, which is elsewhere made so prominent in the play (802, <bibl n="Soph.

<p>The burning of Heracles, and his apotheosis, are combined in some vase paintings. (1) A bowl (<quote lang="greek">krath/r</quote>) of the 4th cent. B.C., now in the Collegio Rainone at  Agata S. dei Goti: Milani, <title>Mito di Filottete</title>, p. 65: Baumeister, <title>Denkm.</title>, p. 307, fig. 322. In the lower part of the picture is the still burning pyre, which a Nymph on the left is trying to quench by pouring water from a jug. The trunk of the hero's mortal body lies on the pyre. On the right, a bearded figure in a peaked cap is hastily receding. This is either Poeas or Philoctetes: at his side is the quiver given him by the hero for kindling the pyre. Above, a Doric portal represents the entrance to Olympus. Apollo, laurel-crowned, sits on the left of it; a four-horse chariot approaches him, preceded by Hermes. It is driven by a winged goddess (a <quote lang="greek">*ni/kh</quote>): on her left sits Heracles, crowned with laurel, his club in his left hand; a light garment (a sort of chlamys) floats round his shoulders. (2) A Lucanian vase, now at Munich: Baumeister, p. 669, fig. 734. Below is the pyre, with the trunk of Heracles on it: the fire is being quenched by two Nymphs on the right <quote lang="greek">*a*p*e*q*o*s*a</quote> and <quote lang="greek">*p*r*e*m*n*o*s*i*a</quote> (an Attic fountain). On the left are two Satyr figures. Above, Athena Nik&egrave;, with helmet, lance, and chequered aegis worn as a corslet, is driving Heracles to Olympus; his left hand holds the club, and round his left arm is wound his chlamys.&mdash;We notice how the participation of Nymphs in these scenes illustrates the poet's <quote lang="greek">*malia/dwn numfa=n</quote> (v. 725).

Three points deserve notice. (1) <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">h(/kei</lemma>=&lsquo;is wont to come,&rsquo;&mdash;a sense which is as fitting for it as for a regular perfect tense used in the &lsquo;gnomic&rsquo; manner (<quote lang="greek">o)/pwpe</quote>,  <bibl n="Soph.

(2) <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">dia\ xro/nou</lemma>, &lsquo;after an interval of time,&rsquo; implies here, as it usually does, that the interval is a considerable one: <bibl n="Soph. Phil. 285">cp. 285</bibl> n., where  <bibl n="Lys. 1.12">Lys. or. 1 &sect; 12</bibl> is cited. (3) <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">pla/nois</lemma> is contrasted with <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">h(/kei</lemma>. The word was suggested by the fact that intermittent fevers  (etc.) were called <quote lang="greek">pla/nhtes</quote> (Hippocr.  <bibl n="Hp. Epid. 1. 944"> <title>Epid.</title> 1. 944</bibl>).

Erotian <title>Gloss.</title> p. 306 (quoted by Arndt) <quote lang="greek">pla/nhtes puretoi\ le/gontai oi( mh\ kata\ ta/cin foitw=ntes</quote>. This may be illustrated by the use of <quote lang="greek">plana=sqai</quote> in  <bibl n="Hdt. 6. 52">Her.  6. 52</bibl>, <quote lang="greek">h)\n de\ plana=tai...e)nalla\c poieu=sa</quote> (&lsquo;if she is <emph>capricious</emph>, varying the order&rsquo;&mdash; opp. to <quote lang="greek">kata\ tau)ta\ ai)ei\ poieu=sa</quote>).

It was easy, then, for the poet to imagine the fitful <quote lang="greek">no/sos</quote> as a personified wanderer, who, when sated with wandering, comes back to her abode:&mdash;much as  Aesch. ( <bibl n="Aesch. PB 275">Aesch. <title>P.

Cp. below, <bibl n="Aesch. PB 808">Aesch. P. V. 808</bibl><quote lang="greek">o)cei=a foita=| kai\ taxei=) a)pe/rxetai</quote>.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)ceplh/sqh. &mdash; i)w/</lemma>. There is no other example of such a hiatus in a tragic trimeter. (As to lyrics, <bibl n="Soph. Phil. 832">cp. 832</bibl>, 851.) Probably, however, the text is sound. The verse is divided between two speakers, there is a full stop after <quote lang="greek">e)ceplh/sqh</quote>, and the second speaker begins with an interjection. Thus the hiatus has an exceptional excuse. On the other hand no emendation is probable. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">feu=</lemma> (instead of the first <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">i)w/</lemma>) is certainly not so, whether it be given to  Ph. or Neoptolemus. Gaisford says, &lsquo;<lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)ce/plhs</lemma>&rsquo;, ut videtur, conj.

The conjecture in the text is my own. I differ from Camerarius in holding that the traditional <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">w)= pai=</lemma> is genuine, and from Neue in holding that the <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)lla\</lemma> is genuine also. The spurious word is <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">de/doik)</lemma>, a gloss upon some rarer expression in the same sense, as Hermann saw; who wrote, <quote lang="greek">a)ll' ou)/ ti/ soi, pai=, mh\ )telh\s eu)xh\ pe/lh|</quote>. First, as to metre. The words <quote lang="greek">a)lla\ de/doik), w)= pai=, mh/ m' a)telh\s eu)xh/</quote> can be read as a dochmiac dimeter, though of an unusual type (cp. J.H.Heinrich Schmidt, <title>Rhythmic and Metric</title>, p. 77). But they cannot be  construed: <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">m)</lemma> can be only <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">me</lemma>: and, though we read <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">eu)/xh|, mh/ m' a)telh\s</lemma> (or <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)telw=s</lemma>) <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">eu)/xh|</lemma> could not mean, &lsquo;lest thou pray vainly <emph>on my behalf.</emph>&rsquo; An iambic trimeter is required here. On this point recent edd. and critics are practically unanimous. In the whole passage from 730 to 826 the series of trimeters is otherwise unbroken, save by those brief cries of  Ph. which occur &lsquo;extra metrum&rsquo; (<bibl n="Soph.

A solitary dochmiac dimeter is here inconceivable. The corruption of the trimeter began with the loss of the last word, as in  <bibl n="Soph. Ant. 1301"> <title>Ant.</title> 1301</bibl> the MS. <quote lang="greek">pe/ric</quote> came from <quote lang="greek">peri\ ci/fei</quote>.

Of these, <quote lang="greek">tu/xh|</quote> alone has any resemblance to <quote lang="greek">eu)xh/</quote>: but <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)/xei</lemma> might easily have dropped out after <quote lang="greek">eu)/xhi</quote>. For the phrase cp.  <bibl n="Soph. OC 652"> <title>O. C.</title> 652</bibl><quote lang="greek">tou= ma/list' o)/knos s' e)/xei</quote>; Next, as to <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)te/lest)</lemma>. An ellipse of <quote lang="greek">h)=</quote> with <quote lang="greek">mh\ a)telh\s eu)xh/</quote> would be too harsh: we must read <quote lang="greek">eu)/xh|</quote>. Again, <quote lang="greek">mh\ a)telh\s eu)/xh|</quote> could not mean, &lsquo;lest thou pray in vain.&rsquo; In <bibl n="Pind.

<p>The volcanic mountain called <quote lang="greek">*mo/suxlos</quote> appears to have been on the east coast of Lemnos, south of the rocky promontory (<quote lang="greek">*(ermai=on o)/ros</quote>, v. 1459) to which the cave of Philoctetes was adjacent.

It was kindled, acc. to one account, by Philoctetes; acc. to another, by his father Poeas.

The other version, which made Poeas the kindler, had a recommendation of a different kind in the eyes of mythologists who aimed at a strict chronology,&mdash;viz., that the episode was thus confined to the generation before the Trojan war.

<p> The place of a second stasimon is taken by this <quote lang="greek">kommo/s</quote>. The strophe (827&mdash;838) is divided from the antistr. (843&mdash;854) by a <quote lang="greek">mesw|do/s</quote>, consisting of four hexameters for Neoptolemus. The antistr. is followed by an <quote lang="greek">e)pw|do/s</quote> (855&mdash;864). For the metres, see Metrical Analysis.</p>
<p>A <quote lang="greek">kommo/s</quote> was properly a lyric lamentation (<quote lang="greek">qrh=nos</quote>) in which one of the actors took part with the Chorus. But the name can be used in a larger sense to describe any lyric dialogue between actor and Chorus, even when the character of a lamentation is not present.</p>
<p>The strophe here was sung by one half of the Chorus, and the antistrophe by the other. Sophocles had raised the number of the tragic Chorus from 12 to 15 by adding a coryphaeus (whose part had hitherto been taken by one of the ordinary choreutae), and two leaders of <quote lang="greek">h(mixo/ria</quote>,&mdash;called <quote lang="greek">parasta/tai</quote>, because, when the Chorus was drawn up facing the actors, they stood on either side of the coryphaeus. The <title>Ajax</title> affords another certain instance of <quote lang="greek">h(mixo/ria</quote> (866 ff.).</p>
<p>The Chorus urge Neoptolemus to seize the moment while Philoctetes sleeps, and to sail away with the bow. He replies that it would be as useless as it would be base to take the bow without its master, whom the oracle has declared to be indispensable. They are still pressing their counsel when the youth perceives that Philoctetes is about to awake.</p>

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">eu)ae\s</lemma> must certainly be a dactyl (see   Anal.), and in 844 the words  <quote lang="greek">w(=n d' a)\n a)mei/bh|</quote> appear sound. But the short <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a^</lemma> in <quote lang="greek">eu)ae\s</quote> has caused perplexity. Certainly elsewhere we find <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a_</lemma> (  <bibl n="Hes. WD 597">Hes. <title>Op.</title> 597</bibl><quote lang="greek">xw/rw| e)n eu)aei=</quote>,  <bibl n="Hom.

Thus, even though <quote lang="greek">a_</quote> was usual in <quote lang="greek">eu)ah/s</quote>, general epic associations would have made it easy for Sophocles to use <quote lang="greek">eu)a^h/s</quote> where metrical convenience required it.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">eu)ai/wn</lemma>, happy, and giving happiness. At Sicyon Pausanias (2. 10. 2) saw a statue of <quote lang="greek">*(/upnos</quote>, with the surname of <quote lang="greek">e)pidw/ths</quote>,&mdash;<foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign> the giver of ever fresh gifts to men,&mdash;the renewer of life. The epithet is explained by  <bibl n="Paus. 8. 9. 1">Paus.  8. 9. 1</bibl> where a Mantinean hieron of <quote lang="greek">*zeu\s *)epidw/ths</quote> is mentioned,&mdash;<quote lang="greek">e)pidido/nai ga\r dh\ a)gaqa\ au)to\n a)nqrw/pois</quote>.

<p>These beautiful verses, which seem to breathe the very spirit of rest, are illustrated by a bronze statue of <quote lang="greek">*(/upnos</quote> now at Vienna. (Baumeister, p. 707.) The Sleep-god is advancing softly; his head is bent; a kindly smile is on his face; his eyes are half-closed; and in his outstretched right hand he holds the horn from which the poppy-juice (<quote lang="greek">mhkw/nion</quote>) is to be shed on weary mortals. The right hand (as replicas show) once held a poppy-stalk,&mdash;answering to the <quote lang="greek">r(a/bdos</quote> with which Hermes seals the eyes of men. Cp. <cit><bibl n="Call.

<p>The MSS. give here <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">poi= de\ ba/sei pw=s de/ moi ta)nteu=qen</lemma>, and in the corresponding v. of the antistrophe (850), <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kei=no/ moi, kei=no la/qra|</lemma>. The want of a verb for <quote lang="greek">pw=s de/ moi ta)nteu=qen</quote> suggests some corruption: we cannot well take <quote lang="greek">ba/sei</quote> with both clauses by changing <quote lang="greek">pw=s de/</quote> (as Hermann proposed) to <quote lang="greek">pw=s te</quote>. Nor, again, is it satisfactory to expand v. 850 by adding <quote lang="greek">tou/tou</quote> or <quote lang="greek">ta)ndro\s</quote> after <quote lang="greek">la/qra|</quote>, or by repeating <quote lang="greek">la/qra|</quote> itself. Wecklein, leaving <quote lang="greek">kei=no/ moi kei=no la/qra|</quote> untouched, writes here <quote lang="greek">poi= de\ ta)nqe/nde ba/sei</quote> (omitting <quote lang="greek">pw=s de/ moi ta)nteu=qen</quote>). But then,&mdash;granting that a dittographia was the cause of error,&mdash;it is hard to see how <quote lang="greek">moi</quote> could have crept in between <quote lang="greek">pw=s de/</quote> and <quote lang="greek">ta)nteu=qen</quote>. I prefer to read <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">poi= de/ moi ta)nqe/nde ba/sei</lemma> here, and to insert <quote lang="greek">dh/</quote> (this with Hermann) after the first <quote lang="greek">kei=no</quote> in 850. The MS. reading may have arisen thus. A transcriber, whose eye chanced to pass over <quote lang="greek">moi ta)nqe/nde</quote>, wrote <quote lang="greek">poi= de\ ba/sei</quote>. Then, perceiving that he had missed two words, he preferred to begin anew, and wrote the whole verse right, but either forgot, or failed to mark clearly, that his original <quote lang="greek">poi= de\ ba/sei</quote> should be deleted. (A similar case occurs in L's text of the metrical <quote lang="greek">*(upo/qesis</quote> to this play: see p. 3.) A successor, finding <quote lang="greek">poi= de\ ba/sei poi= de/ moi ta)nqe/nde ba/sei</quote>, deemed it obvious that the <emph>second</emph> <quote lang="greek">ba/sei</quote> should be omitted. The verse thus became, <quote lang="greek">poi= de\ ba/sei poi= de/ moi ta)nqe/nde</quote>.  But the metrical context showed that a long final syllable was needed; and nothing seemed easier than to correct <quote lang="greek">ta)nqe/nde</quote> into <quote lang="greek">ta)nteu=qen</quote>. Lastly, as a verb such as <quote lang="greek">pra/ceis</quote> seemed to be understood with <quote lang="greek">ta)nteu=qen fronti/dos</quote>, the second <quote lang="greek">poi=</quote> was altered to <quote lang="greek">pw=s</quote>.&mdash;Join <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">poi=</lemma> with <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">fronti/dos</lemma> (partit. gen.): cp.  <bibl n="Soph.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">nu=n d' ai)=re sauto/n</lemma>: which is not, of course, contrasted with <quote lang="greek">su/ m' au)to\s a)=ron</quote>, as if N. meant that  Ph. must rise <emph>without</emph> help: that would be, <quote lang="greek">su d' au)to\s ai)=re sauto/n</quote>. At the same time, N. says that, if  Ph. prefers it, the sailors will lift him up and carry him.  Ph. replies, &lsquo;No, thank you&mdash;help me to rise, as you propose&rsquo; (889). N. assents (893), saying, &lsquo;Stand up, and take hold of me yourself&rsquo; (as I am holding you). And v. 894 marks the moment at which  Ph. slowly rises, leaning on N. Then there is naturally a pause, in order that  Ph. may rest after this effort, and may feel whether he is yet strong enough to attempt walking. It is this pause which is foreshadowed by the words, <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">i(/n), h(ni/k' a)\n ko/pos m' a)palla/ch| pote/</lemma> (880). And it is in this pause that the remorse of Neoptolemus gains the mastery.</p>
<p> ZippmannA. , whom Nauck and Cavallin follow in their texts, deletes both v. 880 and v. 889 as spurious, and transposes 879 to a place between 888 and 890. His two main objections to the traditional text are:&mdash;Why should Ph. , formerly so eager to start, now wish to wait till his <quote lang="greek">ko/pos</quote> has passed off? (880). And why should he desire to rise before that moment, instead of resting on the ground? The view of the whole situation which I have given above will show why I believe the traditional text to be sound.

Since <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ei)</lemma> and <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kai\</lemma> are both of the first class, <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ei) kai\ pa/lin</lemma> is metrically equivalent to a quadrisyllable like <quote lang="greek">ai(rou/menon</quote>, and therefore the rule against a final cretic does not apply.

As to (1), we may observe that in  <bibl n="Soph. OT 1279"> <title>O. T.</title> 1279</bibl> it is almost certain that  Soph. used <quote lang="greek">ai(mato/eis</quote>: Porson there conjectured <quote lang="greek">ai(matou=ss)</quote> (for <quote lang="greek">ai(/matos</quote>): Heath, with greater probability, <quote lang="greek">ai(matou=s</quote>. As to (2), it is true that there is no other instance of this contr. in a superlative: but there are epic examples of the same contr. in the positive:  <bibl n="Hom. Od. 7.110">Hom. <title>Od.</title> 7. 110</bibl><quote lang="greek">texnh=ssai</quote>, restored by Bekker from <quote lang="greek">texnh=sai</quote> (schol. <quote lang="greek">texnh/essai, texniti/des</quote>):  <bibl n="Hom.

LobeckA. , while conceding that Florian Lobeck (<title>Quaest. Ion.</title> p. 8) used &lsquo;too great severity&rsquo; in condemning <quote lang="greek">tolmh/statos</quote>, agrees with him in pointing out that such a contraction as <quote lang="greek">texnh=|s</quote> for <quote lang="greek">texnh/eis</quote> cannot be safely inferred from <quote lang="greek">texnh=ssa</quote> for <quote lang="greek">texnh/essa</quote> (<title>Pathol.</title> 1. 343). This consideration is a fresh argument against Hermann's conj. <quote lang="greek">xalazh=|s</quote> in  <bibl n="Soph. OT 1279"> <title>O. T.</title> 1279</bibl>: and it also reminds us that <quote lang="greek">tolmh/statos</quote> does not imply <quote lang="greek">tolmh=|s</quote>. The example of Oppian (<title>Cyneg.</title> 2. 140 <quote lang="greek">a)rgh=nta xalina/</quote>) shows that late poets did not shrink from this contraction. In Pindar we find <quote lang="greek">ai)gla/enta</quote> (<title>P.</title> 2. 10), <quote lang="greek">a)lka/entas</quote> (<title>O.</title> 9. 77), <quote lang="greek">a)rga/enta</quote> (<title>O.</title> 13. 69), <quote lang="greek">fwna/enta</quote> (<title>O.</title> 2. 93), with synizesis of <quote lang="greek">ae</quote>; though recent edd. no longer write <quote lang="greek">ai)gla=nta</quote>, etc. On the whole, I believe that  Soph. would have felt that he had sufficient poetical warrant for <quote lang="greek">tolmh/state</quote>. No emendation seems possible which is at once tolerable in itself, and such as to account for the tradition. <quote lang="greek">tolmi/state</quote> was a worthless conjecture. Such forms as <quote lang="greek">klepti/statos, farmaki/statos</quote> always imply a positive in <quote lang="greek">-hs</quote> or <quote lang="greek">-os</quote>, and occur only in Comedy or in late prose.

But, having omitted to repeat the verb, the poet has written <quote lang="greek">e)gw/ q)</quote>, since <quote lang="greek">e)gw\ d)</quote> would now have been awkward. Cp.  <bibl n="Soph.

The Ionic and Epic form <quote lang="greek">i)qu/nw</quote>, though unknown to Comedy or classical prose, occurs in our MSS. of  Aesch. and Eur. ,&mdash;and not in lyrics only. Some edd. now always give <quote lang="greek">eu)qu/nw</quote> in  Trag.; unnecessarily, I think.</p>
<p>After a verb of thinking or saying, <quote lang="greek">ou)</quote> is the ordinary negative with the inf.: but <quote lang="greek">mh/</quote> sometimes occurs ( <bibl n="Soph. OT 1455"> <title>O. T.</title> 1455</bibl> n., 2nd ed.). Here the question is, why the second inf. should have <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">mhd)</lemma>, when <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ou)de\n</lemma> precedes the other. Two answers are possible. I place first that which seems to me right. (1) <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ou)de\n</lemma> belongs to <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ka/kion</lemma> only, and not to <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kratu/nein</lemma>. Thus there is no incongruity between <quote lang="greek">ou)de/n</quote> and <quote lang="greek">mhde/</quote>, since only <quote lang="greek">mhde/</quote> belongs to an inf.  This may be seen by supposing an equivalent phrase substituted for <quote lang="greek">sou= ka/kion ou)de/n</quote>: <foreign lang="la">e.g.</foreign>, <quote lang="greek">oi)=mai o(/moia soi\ tou/twn a)\n kratu/nein, mhde\ xei=ron e)piqu/nein</quote>. Schneidewin cp.   <bibl n="Plat. Prot. 319B">Plat. <title>Prot.</title> 319B</bibl> <quote lang="greek">o(/qen de\ au)to\ h(gou=mai ou) didakto\n ei)=nai, mhd' u(p' a)nqrw/pwn paraskeuasto\n a)nqrw/pois, di/kaio/s ei)mi ei)pei=n</quote>: where, if <quote lang="greek">ou)</quote> belonged to <quote lang="greek">ei)=nai</quote>, the immediately following <quote lang="greek">mhde/</quote> would be extremely harsh; while there is no such harshness if <quote lang="greek">ou)</quote> belongs to <quote lang="greek">didakto\n</quote> only, <quote lang="greek">ou)-didakto\n</quote> being equivalent to <quote lang="greek">a)du/naton dida/skesqai</quote>.</p>
<p>(2) The less probable view is that <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ou)de\n</lemma> belongs to <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kratu/nein</lemma>, and, in using <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">mhd)</lemma> instead of <quote lang="greek">ou)d)</quote> before <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)piqu/nein</lemma>, the writer has merely used the other alternative which <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">oi)=mai</lemma> left to him. Now, idiom is partly governed by association, and can even be influenced by false analogy. The sequence of <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ou)</lemma> and <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">mhde/</lemma> was most familiar to the Attic ear in a constr. which opposed their clauses to each other (<quote lang="greek">ou) qa=sson oi)/seis mhd' a)pisth/seis e)moi/</quote>;). It seems unlikely, then, that an Attic writer would wantonly have used <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ou) &hellip; mhde/</lemma> instead of <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ou) &hellip; ou)de/</lemma> in a short sentence where the two negatives were simply coordinate.&mdash;  <bibl n="Eur.

Leaf (on  <bibl n="Hom.

<p><emph>1092 ff.</emph> A discussion of this passage, and a notice of conjectures, will be found in the Appendix. Here I briefly give the results.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">pe/leiai d' a)/nw</lemma> is my emendation of the corrupt <quote lang="greek">&dagger; <emph>ei)/q ai)qe/ros</emph> &dagger; a)/nw</quote>. The word <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ei)/q)</lemma> would be possible only if, in 1094, we read <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">m' e(/loien</lemma> for the MS. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e(/lwsi/ m)</lemma>. But the general sense of the passage forbids this. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)lw=sin</lemma> (conjectured by Erfurdt and others, and found (as <quote lang="greek">e)lw=si/ m)</quote>) in one MS.) is a certain correction of <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e(/lwsi/ m)</lemma>: as <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">i)/sxw</lemma> (Heath) is of <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">i)sxu/w</lemma>. He is not here praying to be caught up by winds, or slain by birds, but saying&mdash;in continuation of <quote lang="greek">tou= pote teu/comai</quote> &verbar; <quote lang="greek">sitono/mou po/qen e)lpi/dos</quote>&mdash;that now the birds will fly unharmed over his head. That <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ai)qe/ros</lemma>, no less than <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ei)/q)</lemma>, is spurious, is made almost certain by two distinct considerations. (1) The antistrophic v., 1113, <quote lang="greek">i^&lt;01&gt;doi_ ma_n de^</quote> &verbar;  <quote lang="greek">ni_n</quote>, is a dochmiac. <quote lang="greek">ai)qe/ros</quote> resolves the second long syll. of the bacchius (= the final syll. of <quote lang="greek">i)doi/man</quote>); not an unexampled licence, but still a most rare one. (2) <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ptwka/des</lemma> is sound, but could not be used, without art. or subst., to denote &lsquo;timid <emph>birds.</emph>&rsquo; <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ai)qi/ros</lemma> has probably supplanted that subst.</p>
<p>But if so, the corruption has been a deep one; <foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign>, <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ei)/q' ai)qe/ros</lemma> was an attempt to supply, from the context, words which had been wholly or partly lost. Now suppose that the words <quote lang="greek">*p*e*a*e*i*a*i *d *a*n*w</quote> had been partly obliterated, so as to leave only <quote lang="greek">*e*i*a*i *a*n*w</quote>. The words <quote lang="greek">a)/nw</quote> and <quote lang="greek">o)cuto/nou pneu/matos</quote> would readily suggest that AI was a vestige of <quote lang="greek">ai)qe/ros</quote>. And the very fact that the schol. accepts <quote lang="greek">ei)/qe e(/lwsi/ me</quote> as possible shows how, in post-classical times, <quote lang="greek">e(/lwsi</quote> might have elicited <quote lang="greek">ei)/q)</quote> from the letters EI.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">su/ toi &hellip; a)po\ mei/zonos</lemma>. In this passage I adhere to the MS. text, merely writing, with Wecklein, <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kou)k</lemma> for <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ou)k</lemma>. The words <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)/lloqen e)/xei tu/xa| ta=|d)</lemma> cannot be metrically reconciled with the corresponding words in the antistrophe (1118 f.), <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)/sx' u(po\ xeiro\s e)ma=s</lemma>. Dindorf assumes that the latter words are sound, and that the fault is in the strophe.  He therefore writes <quote lang="greek">a)/lloqen <emph>a( tu/xa a(/d)</emph> a)po\ mei/zonos</quote>, and thus obtains a dactylic tetrameter, answering to <quote lang="greek">e)/sx' u(po\ xeiro\s e)ma=s: stugera\n e)/xe</quote>. This alteration is, however, extremely bold, since it eliminates <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)/xei</lemma> without attempting to account for it.

But, on the whole, it appears safer to suppose that the fault is in the antistrophe. A very slight change will bring the words <quote lang="greek">e)/sx' u(po\ xeiro\s e)ma=s</quote> into agreement with <quote lang="greek">a)/lloqen e)/xei tu/xa| ta=|d)</quote>.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">tou= lw/|onos dai/monos</lemma>, the MS. reading, is metrically impossible.

But the first syllable of <quote lang="greek">lw/|onos</quote> is necessarily long. A shortening of <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">wi</lemma> before <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">o</lemma> cannot be justified by the similar shortening of <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ai</lemma> or <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">oi</lemma>, as in <quote lang="greek">dei/laios</quote> ( <bibl n="Soph.

Hermann, Dindorf and Wecklein are among those who accept it. In its favour two  points may be noticed. (<emph>a</emph>) <quote lang="greek">dai/mwn</quote>, when it means <quote lang="greek">moi=ra</quote>, is sometimes quite impersonal; <foreign lang="la">e.g.</foreign>, fr. 587 <quote lang="greek">mh\ spei=re polloi=s to\n paro/nta dai/mona</quote> (&lsquo;spread not thy present trouble abroad&rsquo;&mdash;by speech). (<emph>b</emph>) <quote lang="greek">tou= <emph>ple/onos</emph> dai/monos</quote> would be suggested by such phrases as <quote lang="greek">ple/on e)/xein</quote>: <foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign>, it might be possible to say <quote lang="greek">to\n plei/w dai/mon' e)/xw</quote>, or the like, though not <quote lang="greek">o( plei/wn dai/mwn me sw/|zei</quote>. And so the bold phrase seems just conceivable here, where the idea is, &lsquo;Instead of the better portion, thou hast chosen the worse.&rsquo; Omitting <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">tou=</lemma>, Bothe would read <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">lwi+/onos</lemma> (cp.

<p>I should like to read <quote lang="greek">eu=)te/ ge paro\n <emph>kurh=sai</emph> lw/|onos au=) dai/monos ei(/lou to\ ka/kion ai)nei=n</quote>. The loss of <quote lang="greek">au=)</quote> might have led to <quote lang="greek">tou=</quote> being added by some one who thought that the first syll. of <quote lang="greek">lw/|onos</quote> could be short.

The sense is:&mdash; &lsquo;The part of a (true) man is ever to assert what is right, but to do so without adding invectives.&rsquo; That is, Philoctetes is justified in expressing his sense of the wrong done to him; but not in reviling Odysseus.

(2) The Chorus may properly remonstrate with Philoctetes on his invectives against Odysseus; but they could scarcely require him to allow that his treatment had been <quote lang="greek">di/kaion</quote>. (3) The antithesis between the first clause and the second (<lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ei)po/ntos de\</lemma> <foreign lang="greek">k.t.l.</foreign>) thus loses its force; for a man who conceded the justice of the act would not revile the agent.&mdash;Other versions of the vulgate, and other emendations, will be found in the Appendix.

Verse 1149 shoul&lt;*&gt; correspond with v. 1126,  <quote lang="greek">ta\n e)ma\n mele/o&lt;*&gt; trofa/n</quote>. These are glyconic verses. A&lt;*&gt; iambus,  <quote lang="greek">fuga=|</quote>, could not begin such&lt;*&gt; verse, unless its first syll. served merel&lt;*&gt; as anacrusis. If we transpose  <quote lang="greek">fuga=|</quote> b&lt;*&gt; keep  <quote lang="greek">m' ou)ke/t)</quote>, then we have anothe&lt;*&gt; impossibility, viz. a sentence beginnin&lt;*&gt;  with  <quote lang="greek">me</quote>. Other versions of the vulgate which have been proposed are examined in the Appendix.</p>
<p>Auratus and Canter saw that <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">m' ou)ke/t)</lemma> is corrupted from <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">mhke/t)</lemma>. Auratus, keeping <quote lang="greek">pela=t)</quote>, understood (like Wunder), &lsquo;No longer approach, <emph>in order to fly</emph> from my cave,&rsquo;&mdash;an impossible sense for the dat. <quote lang="greek">fuga=|</quote>: though <quote lang="greek">pela=t)</quote> as imperat. might be defended by the verse of an unknown poet in   <bibl n="Plut.

II. p. 80 (1869). <quote lang="greek">*p*e*d*a*t)</quote> (as it would have been written by Sophocles) would most easily become <quote lang="greek">*p*e*d*a*t)</quote>. The change of <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">phda=t)</lemma> into <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">pela=t)</lemma> would have facilitated that of <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">mhke/t)</lemma> into <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">m' ou)ke/t)</lemma>, since <quote lang="greek">pela=t)</quote> would naturally be taken as fut. indic. of <quote lang="greek">pela/zw</quote>, not as imperat. of <quote lang="greek">pela/w</quote>.</p>
<p>The metre would be restored by reading <quote lang="greek">mh\ fugai=s e)/t' a)p' au)li/wn</quote>. But a simpler remedy is to place <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">fuga=|</lemma> last, instead of first, in the v.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)ll' a)ne/dhn</lemma> <quote lang="greek">k.t.l.</quote> The reading of the MSS. here (see cr. n.) presents two great difficulties.

(from <quote lang="greek">a)ni/hmi</quote>, &lsquo;to let go&rsquo;) means, &lsquo;without restraint,&rsquo; &lsquo;with free course&rsquo; (<emph>immissis habenis</emph>), as in  <title>Suppl.</title> 15 <quote lang="greek">feu/gein a)ne/dhn dia\ ku=m' a(/lion</quote>. (2) <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)ru/ketai</lemma>, as the whole usage of the verb shows, must mean either &lsquo;is detained,&rsquo; or else, &lsquo;is warded off.&rsquo; Hence the following versions of the MS. text are impossible:&mdash;(<emph>a</emph>) &lsquo;this place is <emph>remissly guarded</emph>&rsquo;<emph>;</emph> (<emph>b</emph>) &lsquo;this place is <emph>held</emph> by you <emph>in freedom</emph>&rsquo; (schol. <quote lang="greek">e)ru/ketai: kate/xetai</quote>).

<p>In the <title>Journ.

The error would have been an easy one if the apostrophe after <quote lang="greek">a)/r)</quote> had been lost, since <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">xw=ros</lemma> has no verb. That the initial <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a</lemma> of <quote lang="greek">a)/r)</quote> would have been no obstacle, may be seen from the converse case in  <bibl n="Soph. OC 550"> <title>O. C.</title> 550</bibl>, where the MSS. give <quote lang="greek">a)pesta/lh</quote>, corrupted from <quote lang="greek">e)f' a(sta/lh</quote>. Many other false readings have arisen from two words being made into one (or <emph>vice versa</emph>), often with a further corruption of the letters; as  <bibl n="Soph. OC 775"> <title>O. C.</title> 775</bibl><quote lang="greek">tosau/th</quote> for <quote lang="greek">ti/s au(/th</quote>; <emph>ib.</emph> 1482 <quote lang="greek">suntu/xoimi</quote> for <quote lang="greek">sou= tu/xoimi</quote>. The parenthesis, <quote lang="greek">o( de\ xw=ros a)/r' ou)ke/ti</quote> &verbar; <quote lang="greek">fobhto/s, ou)ke/q' u(mi=n</quote>, is naturally placed, because the emphatic word of the whole sentence is <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)ne/dhn</lemma>, and the parenthesis justifies it: &lsquo;Without restraint&mdash;and there is nothing here now, it seems, to restrain you&mdash;go on your way.&rsquo; <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)/ra</lemma> expresses his new and bitter sense of helplessness. With regard to the repeated <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ou)ke/ti</lemma>, it should be noted that such pathetic iteration is peculiarly frequent in this <quote lang="greek">kommo/s</quote>: see 1095 <quote lang="greek">su/ toi, su/ toi</quote>: 1102 <quote lang="greek">w)\ tla/mwn, tla/mwn a)/r' e)gw/</quote>: 1128 <quote lang="greek">w)= to/con fi/lon, w)= fi/lwn k.t.l.</quote>: 1165 <quote lang="greek">a)lla\ gnw=q), eu)= gnw=q)</quote>: 1186 <quote lang="greek">dai/mwn, dai/mwn</quote>: 1197 <quote lang="greek">ou)de/pot), ou)de/pot)</quote>.</p>
<p>The simple transposition, <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">fobhto/s, ou)ke/q)</lemma> (for the MS. <quote lang="greek">ou)ke/ti fobhto/s</quote>), is the best mode of restoring the metre (=1131 <quote lang="greek">e)/xeis to\n *(hra/kleion</quote>). <bibl n="Soph.

<p> Much suspicion has fallen upon these verses. Some critics, indeed, hold that the only resource is to write them anew (see cr. n.). The points to which objection is made are the following.</p>
<p>(1) <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">o(mou=</lemma> as a prep. with the gen. (schol., <quote lang="greek">e)ggu/s</quote>). The dat. is the usual case ( <bibl n="Soph. OT 1007"> <title>O. T.</title> 1007</bibl>). There are, however, two other passages in which the gen. is a well-attested reading. (<emph>a</emph>)   <bibl n="Xen. Anab. 4. 6. 24">Xen. <title>Anab.</title> 4. 6. 24</bibl><quote lang="greek">pri\n de\ o(mou= ei)=nai tou\s pollou\s a)llh/lwn</quote>: three of the best MSS. support the gen., while others give <quote lang="greek">a)llh/lois</quote>. (<emph>b</emph>) Menander fr. incert. 204. The schol. on   <bibl n="Rh.  2.121">Rh.  2. 121</bibl> quotes it as <quote lang="greek">o(mou= de\ tw=| ti/ktein parege/neq' h( ko/rh</quote>: but the mutilated form of it found in Suidas, Photius and Harpocration has <quote lang="greek">tou= ti/ktein o(mou=</quote>. It is noteworthy that the use of <quote lang="greek">o(mou=</quote> in the sense of <quote lang="greek">e)ggu/s</quote> (as distinguished from the sense &lsquo;along with&rsquo;) is said by the schol. on Apollonius to be distinctively  AndAttic. , when it bore this sense, the analogy of <quote lang="greek">e)ggu/s, pe/las</quote>, etc., might easily permit it to be sometimes construed with the gen. See Appendix.</p>
<p>(2) <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">stei/xwn</lemma> is suspected by Nauck, who says, &lsquo;one would rather have expected the aorist (<quote lang="greek">a)pelqw/n</quote>).&rsquo; But the pres. partic. is quite right: &lsquo;moving on my way, I should now have been near my ship.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(3) <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">stei/xonta</lemma> following <quote lang="greek">stei/xwn</quote>. This is a real blemish, though a small one. But it does not follow that it is corrupt. There are several proofs that Sophocles, writing rather for hearers than for readers, was not always careful to avoid such iteration of commonplace words. The emphasis here falls on the contrasted qualifications (<quote lang="greek">new\s o(mou=</quote>, and <quote lang="greek">pe/las</quote>), not on the participles themselves. A recurrence which, in print, catches the eye would hardly have offended the ear. <bibl n="Soph. Phil. 87">Cp. 87</bibl>,  88 <quote lang="greek">pra/ssein</quote> <emph>bis</emph>, with n.,&mdash;265 <quote lang="greek">a)gri/a|</quote>, 267 <quote lang="greek">a)gri/w|</quote>: 1268 f. <quote lang="greek">lo/gwn, lo/gois</quote>.</p>
<p>(4) <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">pro\s h(ma=s deu=r' i)o/nt)</lemma>, repeating the sense of <quote lang="greek">pe/las stei/xonta</quote>. The words are certainly unnecessary; but they are nothing worse. For a like redundancy, cp. Lysias or. 16 &sect; 13 <quote lang="greek">toi=s me\n i(ppeu/ousin a)sfa/leian ei)=nai dei=n nomi/zontas, toi=s d' o(pli/tais ki/ndunon h(goume/nous</quote>, where the second participle merely repeats the sense of the first, and might have been omitted. We could, indeed, take <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">i)o/nt)</lemma> as=<quote lang="greek">i)o/nte</quote> (for the elision of the dual, cp.   <bibl n="Hes. WD 199">Hes. <title>Op.</title> 199</bibl><quote lang="greek">i)/ton prolipo/nt' a)nqrw/pous</quote>), placing commas after <quote lang="greek">go/non</quote> and <quote lang="greek">i)o/nt)</quote>. Then <quote lang="greek">stei/xonta</quote> would refer to both men. &lsquo;I see  Hom. Od.and N. approaching, on their way hither to us.&rsquo; But this is less natural.</p>
<p>On the whole, I incline to think that these four vv. are sound, though (like vv. 265 ff.) they are somewhat carelessly written.

<head>1252-1253</head>
<p> Hermann's earlier view (see cr. n.) seems clearly the true one. Verse 1252, <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)ll' ou)de/ toi</lemma> <foreign lang="greek">k.t.l.</foreign>, is the reply to a lost verse, in which Odysseus said that he would enforce his will with his own hand. Throughout this passage it is Odysseus who threatens, while Neoptolemus stands on the defensive. To Odysseus must belong <quote lang="greek">ou)/ ta)/ra *trwsi/n, a)lla\ soi\ maxou/meqa</quote>, and <quote lang="greek">xei=ra...e)piyau/ousan</quote>: while <quote lang="greek">e)/stw to\ me/llon</quote> and <quote lang="greek">a)lla\ ka)me/...kou) me/llont' e)/ti</quote> are the answers of Neoptolemus. Hence, if we reject the hypothesis of a lost verse, only three resources remain.</p>
<p>(1) To transpose vv. 1252 and 1253. This was Hermann's later theory. The objection to it is that N. then says, <quote lang="greek">a)ll' ou)de/ toi sh=| xeiri\ pei/qomai to\ dra=n</quote>. &verbar; <quote lang="greek">e)/stw to\ me/llon</quote>,&mdash;when the last three words lose the force which they now possess as a short and direct reply to a threat. Further, the verbal echoes in this dialogue (<quote lang="greek">tw=n sofw=n</quote> in 1246, <quote lang="greek">di/kaion</quote> in 1247, <quote lang="greek">fo/bon</quote> in 1251) make it probable that <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">sh=| xeiri\</lemma> in 1252 referred to words of Odysseus which either included <quote lang="greek">xei/r</quote>, or at least foretold his <emph>personal</emph> interference more explicitly than is done by <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">maxou/meqa</lemma>.</p>
<p>(2) To remove v. 1252. Wunder proposes to delete it: Todt, to place it after v. 1290. Neither course is warrantable.</p>
<p>(3) To assume that vv. 1251, 1252 were spoken consecutively by N., and that v. 1252 alludes to a menacing <emph>gesture</emph> of Odysseus. This is Wecklein's view. But it appears scarcely consonant with the character and practice of Greek Tragedy that words spoken by one person should require the dumb action of another to make them clear.</p>
<p>If, then&mdash;as seems hardly doubtful&mdash;a verse has dropped out, its loss may have been due to the fact that it began with the same words as one of its next neighbours. In dialogue of this kind, anger is sometimes marked by derisive repetition: cp.  <bibl n="Soph. OT 547"> <title>O. T.</title> 547</bibl><quote lang="greek">*k*r. tou=t' au)to\ nu=n mou prw=t' a)/kouson w(s e)rw=</quote>. &verbar; <quote lang="greek">*o*i. tou=t' au)to\ mh/ moi fra/z)</quote> etc. (with n. there). Odysseus&mdash;who asserts a <quote lang="greek">di/kaion</quote> of his own (1247)&mdash;may have replied to N.'s words, <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">cu\n tw=| dikai/w| to\n so\n ou) tarbw= fo/bon</lemma>, with some such retort as, <quote lang="greek">cu\n tw=| dikai/w| xei\r e)mh/ s' a)nagka/sei</quote>. Or v. 1252, <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)ll)</lemma>  <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ou)de/ toi</lemma> <foreign lang="greek">k.t.l.</foreign>, may have answered such a verse as, <quote lang="greek">a)ll' ou)d' a)/lupos th=s e)mh=s e)/sei xero/s</quote>.</p>
<p>The textual history of this passage is parallel with that of  <bibl n="Soph. OT 622"> <title>O. T.</title> 622</bibl>&mdash;626, where the loss of one verse led to a similar confusion of persons in the MSS.
</p>

<p>The sacred precinct of Chrys&egrave;, with the serpent, is depicted on a <quote lang="greek">sta/mnos</quote> (wine-jar) of about 400  C.B. , now in the Campana collection at the Louvre. The image of Chrys&egrave; stands in the open air on a low pedestal; just in front of it is a low and rude altar, with fire burning on it; close to this is the serpent, at which Agamemnon is striking with his sceptre, while the wounded Philoctetes lies on the ground, with Achilles and others around him. See Introd. &sect; 21.

<p>This verse implies that both the sons of Asclepius were to have a part in the cure; and so in 1378 f. the plural is used. But, in the prevailing form of the legend, Machaon alone was the healer; probably because, in post-Homeric poetry, Machaon was the representative of surgery, as his brother was of medicine (cp. Preller, 1. p. 409). So Lesches in the <title>Little Iliad</title>, acc.  to Proclus, p. 481 ed. Gaisford: the Orphic <quote lang="greek">*liqika/</quote>, 342 ff., where Machaon uses a powder made from a stone called <quote lang="greek">o)fih=tis</quote>: Tzetzes, <title>Posthom.</title> 580 ff., where the stone is <quote lang="greek">e)xih=tis</quote>: Propertius 2. 1. 59. An epic poet, Dionysius, represented Apollo as putting  Ph. to sleep, when Machaon amputated the diseased part (Tzetzes on Lycophron 911: schol.   <bibl n="Pind. P. 1">Pind. <title>P.</title> 1. 109</bibl>). Quintus Smyrnaeus is singular in making the healer Podaleirius (9. 463).</p>
<p>The scene of the cure occurs on a fragment of a bronze mirror (found in south Etruria, and ascribed to the 5th or 4th cent. B.C.), now in the archaeological Museum of the University of Bologna. It bears an Etruscan legend, <title>Pheltute</title> (Philoctetes), <title>Machan</title> (Machaon). The healer is in the act of bandaging the hero's foot; a sponge and a box of ointment rest on a sort of camp-stool (<quote lang="greek">di/fros o)kladi/as</quote>) between them. (Milani, <title>Mito di F.</title>, pl. III. 49; pp. 104 ff.)</p>

<p>The language here is not strictly logical. It implies that, before the <quote lang="greek">pau=la</quote> can come, he must not only have been relieved (<quote lang="greek">malaxqh=|s</quote>), but also have taken Troy. The explanation seems to be simply that the writer was thinking of the victory as an event which was to follow closely on the cure. So, having used <quote lang="greek">malaxqh=|s</quote>, he subjoined <quote lang="greek">kai\...pe/rsas fanh=|s</quote>, instead of making the second statement independent of <quote lang="greek">pri\n a)/n</quote> (<foreign lang="la">e.g.</foreign>, <quote lang="greek">kai\ e)/peita pe/rsas fanei=</quote>). It is much as if one said, &lsquo;You will never be cured until you find health <emph>and glory</emph> at Troy,&rsquo;&mdash;instead of, &lsquo;find health at Troy,&mdash;where you will also find glory.&rsquo; Schneidewin and others compare  <bibl n="Soph.

<p>We cannot remove the difficulty by supposing that <quote lang="greek">malaxqh=|s</quote> denotes merely alleviation, not cure; for the poet clearly thinks of the cure as preceding the victory (919 f.: 1345 ff.: 1424 ff.).

<p>A decision between the conject. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kakou/s</lemma> and the MS. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kaka/</lemma> demands care. I prefer <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kakou/s</lemma>, for these reasons. (1) <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kaka/</lemma>, if retained, would naturally suggest this sense:&mdash;&lsquo;When a man's mind has once given birth to evil (counsels), it trains <emph>the rest</emph> also (<foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign>, his actions) to be evil.&rsquo; But the antithesis here is between the earlier and the later bad deeds; not between bad counsels and bad deeds. (2) The effect of <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kakou/s</lemma> is to indicate that <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ta)/lla</lemma> stands in antithesis, not with <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kakw=n</lemma> only, but with the whole preceding clause, and thus to suggest its true sense, viz., &lsquo;in all that follows.&rsquo; (3) It is true that the image, <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">mh/thr ge/nhtai</lemma>, is then no longer consistently maintained; but this very failure to persevere with a metaphor is Sophoclean (cp. n. on  <bibl n="Soph. OT 866"> <title>O. T.</title> 866</bibl>). <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">mh/thr ge/nhtai</lemma> is a poetical equivalent for, &lsquo;make a <emph>beginning</emph> of.&rsquo; Hence the poet felt that he did not require <quote lang="greek">a(/pac</quote>, though we should naturally add &lsquo;once.&rsquo; The same delicate economy may be observed in  <bibl n="Soph.

But the rejoinder of  Ph. shows that N. cannot have so spoken; for  Ph. asks,&mdash;&lsquo;Dost thou mean a benefit <emph>to the Atreidae</emph>, or <emph>to me</emph>?&rsquo; N.'s words, then, must have been to this effect,&mdash;&lsquo;Why should one be ashamed, when he is <emph>conferring</emph> a benefit?&rsquo; If, therefore, <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">w)felou/menos</lemma> is to be kept, it must be midd., not pass., &lsquo;benefiting.&rsquo; There are some instances of rare midd. forms in  Soph.

Trach. 103">Soph. <title>Tr.</title> 103</bibl>): but they usually occur in contexts which exclude the pass. sense. Here, a midd. <quote lang="greek">w)felou/menos</quote> would be too ambiguous. The pass. sense of that form was familiar, whereas the midd. sense is unexampled.</p>
<p>Of emendations, Heath's <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">w)feloume/nous</lemma> is the most attractive at first sight. But, if <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">qeou/s</lemma> be left in 1382, then <quote lang="greek">w)feloume/nous</quote> could refer to nothing else: and such phrases as <quote lang="greek">tw=|...dai/moni...su/mmaxos pe/lw</quote> ( <bibl n="Soph.

<p>I am persuaded, then, that the fault in <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">w)felou/menos</lemma> is not confined to the termination. Buttmann's conjecture, <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">w)felw=n fi/lous</lemma>, gives precisely what is required; since <quote lang="greek">fi/lous</quote>, in N.'s mouth, might well suggest Ph.

<div3 id="cl1402" type="commLine" n="1402">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ei) dokei=, stei/xwmen</lemma>. In a trochaic tetrameter the end of the fourth foot regularly coincides with the end of a word. This verse breaks the rule. The only other exception is   <bibl n="Aesch. Pers. 165">Aesch. <title>Pers.</title> 165</bibl>, <quote lang="greek">tau=ta/ moi diplh= me/rimn' a)/frasto/s e)stin e)n fresi/n</quote>, where Porson wished to place <quote lang="greek">diplh=</quote> after <quote lang="greek">fresi/n</quote>, and Hermann, to read <quote lang="greek">me/rimna frasto/s</quote>. Hermann holds that the breach of rule here is excused by the pause after <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">stei/xwmen</lemma>. This I believe to be the true explanation. As <quote lang="greek">stei/xwmen</quote> is the signal that the prayer of  Ph. has at last been granted, it demands emphasis. The unusual rhythm&mdash;which would be too harsh in a continuous verse&mdash;here serves to accentuate the joyful surprise of Philoctetes.</p>
<p>A reference to the critical note will show how unsatisfactory have been the attempts to alter the words, <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">w)= gennai=on ei)rhkw\s e)/pos</lemma>. Porson's fine instinct refrained from any such attempt; he felt that, if the verse was to be amended, only one remedy was tolerable,&mdash;viz., to strike out <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ei) dokei=</lemma>, and leave an iambic trimeter. In favour of this view, it might be said that a scribe, or an actor, who wished to make v. 1402 into a tetrameter, might have been led to <quote lang="greek">ei) dokei=</quote> by a reminiscence of 526 and 645: though we cannot concede to Burges that the spuriousness of <quote lang="greek">ei) dokei=</quote> is bewrayed by the lack of the usual <quote lang="greek">a)lla/</quote> before it. The absence of <quote lang="greek">a)lla/</quote> merely renders <quote lang="greek">ei) dokei=</quote> a little more abrupt.</p>
<p>But the real difficulty in Porson's view arises from a consideration of the whole context. The transition from iambic to trochaic metre marks, as usual, a stirring moment,&mdash;here, the moment of setting out for the ship. I&lt;*&gt; seems clear,  then, that the words which first announce the departure should open the trochaics, rather than close the iambics. So in      <bibl n="Eur. Phoen. 588">Eur. <title>Phoen.</title> 588</bibl>, after the iambic dialogue between Iocasta and Eteocles, the first trochaic verse spoken by the latter is the sign that his fatal resolve is taken,&mdash; <quote lang="greek">mh=ter, ou) lo/gwn e)/q' a(gw/n k.t.l.</quote> Cp. also  <bibl n="Soph.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)qa/naton a)reth\n</lemma>, &lsquo;deathless glory.&rsquo; The difficulties felt regarding <quote lang="greek">a)reth/n</quote> have arisen from the words <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">w(s pa/resq' o(ra=n</lemma>, which imply some visible sign, and thus suggest that <quote lang="greek">a)qa/natos a)reth/</quote> means something more than &lsquo;undying <emph>fame of</emph> prowess.&rsquo; But no emendation is probable (see cr. n.). And the soundness of the text will appear from two considerations.</p>
<p>(1) The use of <quote lang="greek">a)reth/</quote> as=&lsquo;reputation won by merit&rsquo; was familiar: <foreign lang="la">e.g.</foreign>, Lycurgus <title>In Leocr.</title> &sect; 49 (quoted by Cavallin) <quote lang="greek">ta\ ga\r a)=qla tou= pole/mou toi=s a)gaqoi=s a)ndra/sin e)sti\n e)leuqeri/a kai\ a)reth/</quote>. By an easy transition, this idea of fame won by deeds passed into that of &lsquo;distinction&rsquo;: cp. Theog. 29 <quote lang="greek">mhd' ai)sxroi=sin e)p' e)/rgmasi mhd' a)di/koisin</quote> &verbar; <quote lang="greek">tima\s mhd' a)reta\s e(/lkeo mhd' a)/fenos</quote>: &lsquo;and do not, by shameful deeds or unjust, grasp at honours, or <emph>distinctions</emph>, or wealth&rsquo;; where the <quote lang="greek">timai/</quote> refer to office or rank, and the <quote lang="greek">a)retai/</quote>, as the context shows, also denote pre-eminence recognised in some external form.</p>
<p>(2) The force of the epithet should be observed. When Plato says, <quote lang="greek">u(pe\r a)reth=s a)qana/tou...pa/ntes pa/nta poiou=sin</quote> ( <bibl n="Plat. Sym. 208"> <title>Symp.</title> 208</bibl>D), the <quote lang="greek">a)qa/natos a)reth/</quote> is the reputation which survives <emph>on earth.</emph> But here <quote lang="greek">a)qa/natos a)reth/</quote> is &lsquo;the distinction of one who has been made immortal&rsquo;: <foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign>, &lsquo;deathless glory&rsquo; here means &lsquo;glorious immortality.&rsquo; Thus the peculiar sense of <quote lang="greek">a)reth/n</quote> is helped by that sense which the context gives to <quote lang="greek">a)qa/naton</quote>.</p>

Two views of these words are possible. I prefer the first.</p>
<p>(1) <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">tau=t)</lemma> refers to the general tenor of the preceding verses, from 1423 onwards, &mdash;viz., that  Ph. is to go to Troy with N., and there triumph. &lsquo;And to <emph>thee</emph> (as well as to Ph. ) I give these counsels&rsquo;: <foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign>, it concerns thee, too, to note that he must accompany thee to Troy.

A modified form of this view refers <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">tau=t)</lemma> only to v. 1431, as if Heracles meant that Neoptolemus also must bring spoils to the pyre: but this seems less fitting.</p>
<p>(2) <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">tau=t)</lemma> refers to what follows: the aor. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">parh/|nesa</lemma> is then like <quote lang="greek">a)pw/mosa</quote> in 1289 (n.): and the <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ga\r</lemma> after <quote lang="greek">ou)/te</quote> merely introduces the statement (1049). I do not share Buttmann's feeling that <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kai\ soi\</lemma> ought then to be <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">soi\ de\</lemma>: but the whole context appears to render the first view more natural.</p>
<p>Heracles confirms what Odysseus had said (115). In glorifying Philoctetes, it was necessary to respect the legend which ascribed the capture of Troy to Neoptolemus (who was the hero of the <quote lang="greek">*)ili/ou pe/rsis</quote>, by Arct&icirc;nus).</p>

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*)asklhpio\n</lemma>. In the <title>Iliad</title> Asclepius is a mortal, an <quote lang="greek">a)mu/mwn i)hth/r</quote> living in western Thessaly, whose two sons, the physicians Podaleirius and Machaon, go thence to Troy. But Sophocles here thinks of Asclepius as a god, whom Heracles is to send from heaven. Prosaic objections have been made to this passage, on the ground that in 1333 it was said that  Ph. was to be healed by the Asclepiadae. But it might be replied that those were merely the words of Neoptolemus, who was giving his own interpretation to a vague prediction of Helenus that  Ph. would be healed. Even, however, if the oracle itself spoke of the Asclepiadae, there is no poetical unfitness in this further promise&mdash;that the healing god himself should visit Troy, to direct and inspire their skill.</p>
<p>Tradition placed Sophocles in a near relation to the cult of Asclepius. The poet is said to have been invested with the &lsquo;priesthood&rsquo; (<quote lang="greek">i(erwsu/nh</quote>, <title>Vit.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">eu)sebei=n</lemma>.

The outrage of Ajax Oileus on Cassandra, in the temple of Athena at Troy (  <bibl n="Eur. Tro. 70">Eur. <title>Tro.</title> 70</bibl>), was another instance of <quote lang="greek">dusse/beia</quote>.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">w(s ta)/lla pa/nta</lemma> <quote lang="greek">k.t.l.</quote> The ground for the precept (<quote lang="greek">eu)sebei=n</quote>) is given by <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">w(s</lemma>,&mdash;viz., that Zeus deems &lsquo;all other things,&rsquo;&mdash;such as conquest, or glory&mdash;of secondary moment (<lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">deu/ter' h(gei=tai</lemma>: cp.  <bibl n="Soph. OC 351"> <title>O. C.</title> 351</bibl>). Then the sentence introduced  by <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ga/r</lemma> explains why Zeus so deems; viz., because the effect of <quote lang="greek">eu)se/beia</quote> does not cease with man's life on earth, but is imperishable. That is, it brings happiness to the <quote lang="greek">eu)sebh/s</quote> in the life beyond the grave; and it is also of good example to the men who come after. Heracles can fitly say this; he is himself enjoying the reward of <quote lang="greek">eu)se/beia</quote>, and he comes from the presence of Zeus.</p>
<p>In v. 1443 the old emendation <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ou)</lemma>, for <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">h(</lemma>, seems an almost certain one: but the case in favour of it has not yet, perhaps, been adequately stated. It is not merely, or even chiefly, a verbal question; we must consider the whole passage. If we retain the MS. reading, <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">h( ga\r eu)se/beia sunqnh/|skei brotoi=s</lemma>, &lsquo;piety dies with mortals,&rsquo; the meaning is, &lsquo;piety <emph>passes</emph> with men <emph>into the other life</emph>,&rsquo; there to find a reward. (Cp. Rev. xiv. 13, <quote lang="greek">ta\ ga\r e)/rga au)tw=n a)kolouqei= met' au)tw=n</quote>.) Now, this narrows the scope of the thought in an arbitrary way: for then <quote lang="greek">eu)se/beia</quote> is regarded only in its influence on the happiness of the departed. If, however, we read <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ou) ga\r hu(se/beia sunqnh/|skei brotoi=s</lemma>, this allows us to think <emph>also</emph> of the abiding influence upon human conduct; and the more comprehensive view is certainly the more fitting one in an exposition of the reason why <title>Zeus</title> attributes a paramount importance to <quote lang="greek">eu)se/beia</quote>.</p>
<p>A further objection to the MS. reading arises from the sense given to <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">sunqnh/|skei</lemma>, which, though intelligible (in the light of v. 1444), would be forced. The regular meaning of <quote lang="greek">qnh/|skw</quote> and its compounds, when used figuratively, is &lsquo;to become inoperative&rsquo; or &lsquo;extinct,&rsquo; in contrast with <quote lang="greek">zh=n</quote>: <foreign lang="la">e.g.</foreign>,  <bibl n="Soph.

In   <bibl n="Aristoph.

<p>Two objections have been made to the emendation <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ou)</lemma> for <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">h(</lemma>. (1) The position of <quote lang="greek">ou)</quote>. But <quote lang="greek">ou)</quote> is rightly so placed, because, as <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ta)/lla pa/nta</lemma> indicates, there is an implied contrast between <quote lang="greek">eu)se/beia</quote> and other things which <emph>do</emph> perish with men. Cp.  Soph. fr. incert. 841 <quote lang="greek">ou) toi=s a)qu/mois h( tu/xh cullamba/nei</quote> (though it <emph>does</emph> aid the brave). (2) The thought, <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ou) &hellip; sunqnh/|skei</lemma>, is repeated by <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ou)k a)po/llutai</lemma>. But v. 1444 is not a mere repetition; it is a re-statement in more forcible language, and, as such, it is rhetorically appropriate here.</p>
<p>Dindorf rejects all three verses (1442&mdash;  1444). But the conclusion, at v. 1441, would then be too abrupt. Schneidewin formerly spared v. 1442, rejecting only the two next vv. He supposed (<emph>a</emph>) that <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*zeu/s</lemma> was a gloss on <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">path/r</lemma>: (<emph>b</emph>) that some one had written vv. 1443 f. in the margin, the original form of 1443 having been, <quote lang="greek">a)ll' h( ga\r eu)se/beia sugghra=|</quote> (or <quote lang="greek">sunnai/ei</quote>) <quote lang="greek">brotoi=s</quote>: then a scribe evolved our text. This hypothesis is too complex: besides, the speech would not end well with v. 1442. One of Hermann's views (see cr. n.) was that v. 1444 only should be rejected (<quote lang="greek">ou)</quote> being read in 1443): but this, too, would be ineffective.

<p>The place of <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ga\r</lemma> as sixth word is noteworthy.

<p><emph>1459</emph> This <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*(ermai=on o)/ros</lemma> is mentioned in only one other passage of classical literature,&mdash;  <bibl n="Aesch. Ag. 283">Aesch. <title>Ag.</title> 283</bibl>, where the <quote lang="greek">*(ermai=on le/pas *ah/mnou</quote> is the signalling station intermediate between Ida and Athos. It is doubtless the N. E. promontory of Lemnos, now Cape Plaka.</p>
<p>The only rival claim is that of Mount Skopia, near Cape Murzephlo (the N.W. promontory), which has greatly the advantage of Plaka in height. But two points are in favour of Plaka. (1) It was a fitting place for the beacon; for it is in a direct line between Ida and Athos; it is the nearest point to the Troad; and it runs out far into the sea. (2) The cave of Philoctetes commanded a view of the volcano Mosychlus (v. 800), and his cries were re-echoed from Mount Hermaeum. The two hills were therefore at no very great distance from each other. But there is no reason to suppose that a volcano ever existed near Cape Murzephlo, while there is some ground for thinking that one may have existed on the eastern coast (cp. Appendix on v. 800). See Tozer, <title>Islands of the Aegean</title>, pp. 273 f. (1890).</p>
<p>Hermaeum occurs elsewhere also as the ancient name of a promontory,&mdash; <foreign lang="la">e.g.</foreign>, in Sardinia (=C. Marrargiu, on the W. coast), and on the European shore of the Bosporus (=Rumili Hissar).</p>
<p>The MSS. give the accent <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*(/ermaion</lemma> here, but <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*(ermai=on</lemma> is right. Adjectives in <quote lang="greek">-aios</quote>, of more than two syllables, were regularly properispomenon, like <quote lang="greek">*)aqhnai=os</quote>.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*lu/kio/n te poto/n</lemma>. There can be no doubt that <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*lu/kion</lemma> is the true reading: the corruption <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">glu/kion</lemma>, facilitated by the use of a small <quote lang="greek">l</quote> as initial, may have been due simply to the fact that the Greeks, like ourselves, spoke of &lsquo;fresh&rsquo; water as &lsquo;sweet&rsquo; (<quote lang="greek">gluku/</quote>, as dist. from <quote lang="greek">a(lmuro/n</quote>). The <quote lang="greek">*lu/kion poto/n</quote> must be a spring, or fount, in Lemnos, so called after Apollo <quote lang="greek">*lu/kios</quote>. There was a more elaborate legend,&mdash;that this god, wishing to alleviate the sufferings of Philoctetes, had caused two fountains to arise in the island,&mdash;one of wine, and the other of honey. (Zenobius 4. 99, etc.: cp. Hermann's note here.) We do not know whether this <quote lang="greek">*lu/kion poto/n</quote> had been mentioned by any poet before Sophocles, &mdash;by Lesches, for example: but the way in which the name is introduced favours that supposition. Perhaps, indeed, a &lsquo;Lycian&rsquo; fount at Lemnos may have been well known to Athenians in the poet's day. </p>
<p>Traces of Apollo <quote lang="greek">*lu/kios</quote> in Lemnos are not surprising. From early times he had been worshipped under that title, not only in the valley of the Xanthus, but also in the Troad (cp.  <bibl n="Hom. Il. 4.101"> <title>Il.</title> 4. 101</bibl>, with Leaf's note). A gloss in Hesychius (s.v. <quote lang="greek">*lukai=on</quote>) points to a cognate worship of Apollo in the neighbouring islet of Chrys&egrave;. <quote lang="greek">*lu/kios</quote> and <quote lang="greek">*lu/keios</quote> may both alike be referred to <quote lang="greek">luk</quote>, as designating the god of light. In actual Greek usage, while <quote lang="greek">*lu/keios</quote> was usually connected with the idea of <quote lang="greek">lukokto/nos</quote> ( <bibl n="Soph. OT 203"> <title>O. T.</title> 203</bibl> n.), <quote lang="greek">*lu/kios</quote> was chiefly associated with Lycia. But, instead of the title <quote lang="greek">*lu/kios</quote> being derived thence, it is more likely that the country of the people once called Trem&icaron;lae took its name from the cult of the <quote lang="greek">*lu/kios</quote>. (Cp. Preller, I. 202.)</p>
<p>It has been objected to the mention of <quote lang="greek">krh=nai</quote> that at v. 717  Ph. was described as having only <quote lang="greek">stato\n u(/dwr</quote>: but that was merely the conjecture of the Chorus. <bibl n="Soph.
